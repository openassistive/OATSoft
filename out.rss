<description>The Web Page Communicator Templates are a set of Internet Explorer compatible web pages that are used to create web pages that behave similarly to dynamic display speech generating devices. Now many platforms capable of running Internet Explorer 4.0 or newer can be used as simple communications devices. The pages support multiple access methods including single switch and two switch scanning, linear or row-column scans, and auditory scanning. formEdit is a template editor that makes it easy to build a useful communications page using the Web Page Communicator templates. The current template set offers choice grids with 4 to 24 cells.</description> <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher> <dc:creator>jimluther</dc:creator> <dc:rights></dc:rights> <dc:date>2008-05-14T08:19:54Z</dc:date> <dc:type>OATS</dc:type> </item> <item rdf:about="http://web.archive.org/web/20160223140059/http://www.oatsoft.org/Software/power-reader">

<description>ICUTalk was a research project, funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) from 1999 to 2002. The project developed an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) system to help patients in Intensive Care Units (ICU) who are temporarily unable to speak due to their medical condition or treatment, namely the intubation procedure. This was a multi-disciplinary collaborative project involving staff from the University of Dundee (School of Computing and the School of Nursing &amp; Midwifery) and Ninewells Hospital, Dundee (Speech &amp; Language Therapy and Intensive Care Unit). Andy Judson was the software developer and Professor Ian Ricketts was the primary investigator and Dr Annalu Waller was the secondary. The software has continued to be developed (although its been a wee bit slow), it remains in use in Ninewells Hospital, and there has been wider interest in it from around the world (not enough to warrant selling it though).</description> <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher> <dc:creator>ajudson</dc:creator> <dc:rights></dc:rights> <dc:date>2008-06-25T08:04:26Z</dc:date> <dc:type>OATS</dc:type> </item> <item rdf:about="http://web.archive.org/web/20160223140059/http://www.oatsoft.org/Software/saw-resources">
