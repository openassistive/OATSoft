"AutoIT";"AutoIt v3 is a freeware BASIC-like scripting language designed for automating the Windows GUI and general scripting.

It will cover a set of concepts covering the authorized Blissymbolics vocabulary of around 4450 Bliss-words. These will be organised in a Base Reference Ontology (BRO) with concepts covered by WordNet, and a Complementary Reference Ontology (CRO) for the rest. The Concept Coded concepts in the Reference Ontologies will be linked to an open ended numbers of so called Assistive Ontologies containing the different supported language representations for the concepts - Bliss being the first target for graphical symbol representations, and English and Swedish being the first natural language lexicons fully supported. The structure is already prepared for supporting a number of other symbolic representations, as well as all Scandinavian/Nordic, and a number of other European languages. More will be added as soon as interest and resources will be around. <br /></p><p>In technical terms; the first release will contain a Java based CCF Tool for browsing and managing the CCF resources (<a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://wordnet.princeton.edu/"">WordNet</a>, the BRO and CRO, Assistive Ontologies and symbol resources). The data will be stored in or retrieved from either a MySQL database or an RDF/XML based resource. <br /></p><p>The first practical implementation will be an updated version of the <a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.symbolnet.org/en/index.html"">SYMBERED</a> tool for creating symbol supported web content via a CMS module written in PHP working towards the MySQL database.

With the Bliss Think Tank in July'07 we've been busy hacking more demonstrators. Mats, Bengt and Lars have been busy fine-tuning the <a title=""Symbol &amp; Concept Coding Editor (aka SYMBERED)"" href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.oatsoft.org/Software/SymBeRed"">SYMBERED</a> system (CCF support for CMS - using PHP, MySQL, Java). I've been busy working on a .NET infrastructure and building a central CCF ontology in SQLServer. The database I've been working with is now populated with around 9000 concepts (based on the STANDUP project ontology) and around 3000 Bliss symbols (some of which are mapped to concept codes). There is an prototype asp.net website where you can search the ontologies, update the bliss-ccf mappings, write ruby annotated bliss messages (then you can copy the source to your own website like I've done below). This webservice could be used as a portal to manage the ccf, and more excitingly, for use by other software / web applications, e.g. <a title=""FoxySymbols"" href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.oatsoft.org/Software/foxysymbols"">FoxySymbols</a>. I hope to get the webservice &amp; database hosted soon.<br /></p><h2>Background</h2><p>Around the world, people with impaired communication, including difficulties to read or write, may use symbols as an alternative or complement to character based texts. Referencing to, and exchanging these alternatively coded messages over the Internet is difficult due to the lack of standardised encoding schemes and common practises. This site is intended to motivate, describe and promote the introduction and adoption of a common, open and vendor neutral Concept Coding Framework (CCF) to overcome some of these difficulties. In particular will act as a base for all contribution to this work - be it formal documentation or informal discussions. </p><p>The suggested CCF has been carefully designed to be conformant to the standard language technologies that are rapidly developing and penetrating the Internet communities. In this way we believe that the proposed CCF can contribute to a major leap in bridging between different technologies and products developed for AAC users and, more importantly, between these Assistive Technologies (AT) and the main-stream technologies of today's and tomorrow's networked information society. </p><p>The bridging approach also implies that the CCF is not intended to replace and exclude the use and development of current and future proprietary assistive technologies in the AAC field. Instead the CCF and its bridging technology and tools are designed to provide added value for all stake-holders; AAC users, special product developers and service providers, as well as general service and information providers who want to support improved accessibility to their products. </p><p>Designed to be used over the Internet for email, web-based activities, chat and/or other emerging Internet based services, the CCF technology can, however, be used by software manufacturers also to provide additional functionality, enhanced support for, and integration of, software and systems with multi-modal language features mainly intended for local use. </p><p>Although, this work is part of the EU funded WWAAC project, the concept coding work is to be kept open source as we want to collaborate with experts and stakeholders in both the AAC field and internet technologies/accessibility area. Thus we are wanting to use this area to establish an interest group in the concept coding approach. if you are interested in getting involved at whatever level then please contact us.</p><h2>Links</h2><p>These are some of the most relevant links i can think of to share, if you have others, please add them. </p><h3>research projects</h3><ul type=""circle""><li><a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.wwaac.eu/"">wwaac</a> project (the eu project that funded this initial work) </li></ul><blockquote><div align=""left""><ul><li>""<a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.wwaac.eu/products/Docs/D10_v10%20CoP.pdf"">Code ofPractice</a>"" -

More to appear here soon after the recent move of the server home of OATS, as well as for the conceptcoding.org domain. More to come - soon hopefully ...</p><br /><h3>3 September 2009 - (Mats Lundälv)</h3><p>The summer has passed and the work towards the first CCF release is slowly progressing. Will we make it during the 3rd quarter of 2009 as envisaged ? Well - surprise - possibly not :-/ It currently looks uncertain whether we will be ready during this month. It will probably be a bit later this autumn. <br /></p><p>Bengt Farre's completely re-written new SYMBERED version is getting close to completion, but still has some way to go.</p><p>The good news is that Lars Nordberg is well on the way to transfer our CCF databases from MySQL to the <a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://developers.sun.com/javadb/"">Sun JavaDB</a> (based on <a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://db.apache.org/derby/"">Apache Derby</a>) Java database. This will provide another option for providing CCF resources (in addition to the MySQL and RDF resources) in a light weight format that will be easier to deploy, install and use for those who will like to try working with CCF based applications and services.</p><p>We'll keep you updated at this space ..</p><br /><h3>19 June 2009 - (Mats Lundälv)</h3><p>A first full release of the updated CCF package is now envisaged during the 3rd quarter of 2009. It will cover a set of concepts covering the authorized Blissymbolics vocabulary of around 4450 Bliss-words. These will be organised in a Base Reference Ontology (BRO) with concepts covered by WordNet, and a Complementary Reference Ontology (CRO) for the rest. The Concept Coded concepts in the Reference Ontologies will be linked to an open ended numbers of so called Assistive Ontologies containing the different supported language representations for the concepts - Bliss being the first target for graphical symbol representations, and English and Swedish being the first natural language lexicons fully supported. The structure is already prepared for supporting a number of other symbolic representations, as well as all Scandinavian/Nordic, and a number of other European languages. More will be added as soon as interest and resources will be around. <br /></p><p>In technical terms; the first release will contain a Java based CCF Tool for browsing and managing the CCF resources (<a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://wordnet.princeton.edu/"">WordNet</a>, the BRO and CRO, Assistive Ontologies and symbol resources). The data will be stored in or retrieved from either a MySQL database or an RDF/XML based resource. <br /></p><p>The first practical implementation will be an updated version of the <a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.symbolnet.org/en/index.html"">SYMBERED</a> tool for creating symbol supported web content via a CMS module written in PHP working towards the MySQL database. (This will be a complete re-write of the first SYMBERED version based on the <a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.papunet.net/"">Papunet </a>CMS). </p><p>The next practical implementation will be the first prototypes of the envisaged CCF symbol support plugin extension for OpenOffice.org within the AEGIS project - planned for the 4th quarter of 2009.<br /></p><h3>08 June 2009 - (Mats Lundälv)</h3><p>In the AEGIS project 1:st international workshop (in Slough at RIM 05 June) Dr. Christian Galinski from <a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.infoterm.info/"">Infoterm </a>gave a very interesting and informative presentation on issues concerning ""Standards for content in the field of eInclusion - and beyond"" - with great relevance for the CCF work in particular, and for the <a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.aegis-project.eu/"">AEGIS </a>and <a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.raisingthefloor.net/"">Raising The Floor</a> projects in general. We will have to do some studying about ISO//TC 37 ""Terminology and other language and content resources"" ;-)  I hope the presentations will be on-line soon.<br /></p><h3><b>22 February 2009 - (Mats Lundälv)</b></h3><p>The  concept coding work has continued in slow pace as follow up work after the Nordic <a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.symbolnet.org/en/"">SYMBERED project</a> - which is still ongoing. <br />It is now brought further in relation to a task within the ongoing European and international <a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.aegis-project.eu/"">AEGIS-project</a>. Concept coding will be employed in building open source components for graphic symbol support - in OpenOffice.org, as well as in prototype Java based cross-platform AAC applications - for mobile devices and other environments.<br /></p><h3><b>03/12/2007 - (Andy Judson)</b><br /></h3><p>With my move from the University of Dundee's School of Computing, I thought it time I ported the old CCF website to the OATS portal. With the Bliss Think Tank in July'07 we've been busy hacking more demonstrators. Mats, Bengt and Lars have been busy fine-tuning the <a title=""Symbol &amp; Concept Coding Editor (aka SYMBERED)"" href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.oatsoft.org/Software/SymBeRed"">SYMBERED</a> system (CCF support for CMS - using PHP, MySQL, Java). I've been busy working on a .NET infrastructure and building a central CCF ontology in SQLServer. The database I've been working with is now populated with around 9000 concepts (based on the STANDUP project ontology) and around 3000 Bliss symbols (some of which are mapped to concept codes). There is an prototype asp.net website where you can search the ontologies, update the bliss-ccf mappings, write ruby annotated bliss messages (then you can copy the source to your own website like I've done below). This webservice could be used as a portal to manage the ccf, and more excitingly, for use by other software / web applications, e.g. <a title=""FoxySymbols"" href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.oatsoft.org/Software/foxysymbols"">FoxySymbols</a>. I hope to get the webservice &amp; database hosted soon.<br /></p><h2>Background</h2><p>Around the world, people with impaired communication, including difficulties to read or write, may use symbols as an alternative or complement to character based texts. Referencing to, and exchanging these alternatively coded messages over the Internet is difficult due to the lack of standardised encoding schemes and common practises. This site is intended to motivate, describe and promote the introduction and adoption of a common, open and vendor neutral Concept Coding Framework (CCF) to overcome some of these difficulties. In particular will act as a base for all contribution to this work - be it formal documentation or informal discussions. </p><p>The suggested CCF has been carefully designed to be conformant to the standard language technologies that are rapidly developing and penetrating the Internet communities. In this way we believe that the proposed CCF can contribute to a major leap in bridging between different technologies and products developed for AAC users and, more importantly, between these Assistive Technologies (AT) and the main-stream technologies of today's and tomorrow's networked information society. </p><p>The bridging approach also implies that the CCF is not intended to replace and exclude the use and development of current and future proprietary assistive technologies in the AAC field. Instead the CCF and its bridging technology and tools are designed to provide added value for all stake-holders; AAC users, special product developers and service providers, as well as general service and information providers who want to support improved accessibility to their products. </p><p>Designed to be used over the Internet for email, web-based activities, chat and/or other emerging Internet based services, the CCF technology can, however, be used by software manufacturers also to provide additional functionality, enhanced support for, and integration of, software and systems with multi-modal language features mainly intended for local use. </p><p>Although, this work is part of the EU funded WWAAC project, the concept coding work is to be kept open source as we want to collaborate with experts and stakeholders in both the AAC field and internet technologies/accessibility area. Thus we are wanting to use this area to establish an interest group in the concept coding approach. if you are interested in getting involved at whatever level then please contact us.</p><h2>Links</h2><p>These are some of the most relevant links i can think of to share, if you have others, please add them. </p><h3>research projects</h3><ul type=""circle""><li><a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.wwaac.eu/"">wwaac</a> project (the eu project that funded this initial work) </li></ul><blockquote><div align=""left""><ul><li>""<a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.wwaac.eu/products/Docs/D10_v10%20CoP.pdf"">Code ofPractice</a>"" -

"Dasher";"Dasher is an information-efficient text-entry interface, driven by natural continuous pointing gestures.";"<h2 class=""Heading"">From the authors:</h2><p>Dasher is a zooming interface. You point where you want to go, and the display zooms in wherever you point. The world into which you are zooming is painted with letters, so that any point you zoom in on corresponds to a piece of text. The more you zoom in, the longer the piece of text you have written. You choose what you write by choosing where to zoom. </p><p></p><p>To make the interface efficient, we use the predictions of a language model to determine how much of the world is devoted to each piece of text. Probable pieces of text are given more space, so they are quick and easy to select. Improbable pieces of text (for example, text with spelling mistakes) are given less space, so they are harder to write. The language model learns all the time: if you use a novel word once, it is easier to write next time. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>A big advantage of Dasher over other predictive text-entry interfaces that offer word-completions to the user is that it is <b>mode-free</b>: the user does not need to switch from a writing mode to an ""accept-model-predictions"" mode. </p><p>Another advantage is that it is easy to train the model on any writing style: simply load up an example file, then write away!</p><br /><h2 class=""Heading"">OATS Comment:</h2><p>Dasher is an amazing innovation on on-screen keyboards - although at first it might seem difficult, stick with it and you will be astounded at how efficient it is.  Although mainly aimed at users who can use a mouse (or similar device) the Dasher team are working on a switch accessible version.  There is also a version that works well with speech recognition software - <a title=""Speech Dasher"" href=""resolveuid/d8eeddfaf075fb166fb7a4b60529a52d"" target=""_self"">Speech Dasher</a>.<br /></p><h2 class=""Heading"">See Dasher in action:</h2><p>David MacKay demonstrated Dasher at the Bett 2006 Special Needs Fringe and you can <a href=""/web/20150424043338/http://www.l4l.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=76&amp;Itemid=1"" target=""_self"">watch the video</a> created by Leon Cych.Dasher 4.9.0 is now available for download from:</p><p> </p><p>  <a href=""/web/20150424043338/http://download.gnome.org/sources/dasher/4.9/"">http://download.gnome.org/sources/dasher/4.9/</a></p><p> </p><p>Windows binaries will shortly be available from:</p><p> </p><p> <a href=""/web/20150424043338/http://www.dasher.org.uk/Download.html"">http://www.dasher.org.uk/Download.html</a></p><p> </p><p>Dasher is a predictive text input system for the GNOME Desktop, suitable for any situation in which a conventional keyboard cannot be used.</p><p> </p><p>This is the first in a new development series, including a large number of improvements from a wide variety of contributors.

More to come - soon hopefully ...</p><br /><h3>3 September 2009 - (Mats Lundälv)</h3><p>The summer has passed and the work towards the first CCF release is slowly progressing.

It will cover a set of concepts covering the authorized Blissymbolics vocabulary of around 4450 Bliss-words. These will be organised in a Base Reference Ontology (BRO) with concepts covered by WordNet, and a Complementary Reference Ontology (CRO) for the rest. The Concept Coded concepts in the Reference Ontologies will be linked to an open ended numbers of so called Assistive Ontologies containing the different supported language representations for the concepts - Bliss being the first target for graphical symbol representations, and English and Swedish being the first natural language lexicons fully supported. The structure is already prepared for supporting a number of other symbolic representations, as well as all Scandinavian/Nordic, and a number of other European languages.

With the Bliss Think Tank in July'07 we've been busy hacking more demonstrators. Mats, Bengt and Lars have been busy fine-tuning the <a title=""Symbol &amp; Concept Coding Editor (aka SYMBERED)"" href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.oatsoft.org/Software/SymBeRed"">SYMBERED</a> system (CCF support for CMS - using PHP, MySQL, Java). I've been busy working on a .NET infrastructure and building a central CCF ontology in SQLServer. The database I've been working with is now populated with around 9000 concepts (based on the STANDUP project ontology) and around 3000 Bliss symbols (some of which are mapped to concept codes). There is an prototype asp.net website where you can search the ontologies, update the bliss-ccf mappings, write ruby annotated bliss messages (then you can copy the source to your own website like I've done below). This webservice could be used as a portal to manage the ccf, and more excitingly, for use by other software / web applications, e.g. <a title=""FoxySymbols"" href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.oatsoft.org/Software/foxysymbols"">FoxySymbols</a>. I hope to get the webservice &amp; database hosted soon.<br /></p><h2>Background</h2><p>Around the world, people with impaired communication, including difficulties to read or write, may use symbols as an alternative or complement to character based texts. Referencing to, and exchanging these alternatively coded messages over the Internet is difficult due to the lack of standardised encoding schemes and common practises. This site is intended to motivate, describe and promote the introduction and adoption of a common, open and vendor neutral Concept Coding Framework (CCF) to overcome some of these difficulties. In particular will act as a base for all contribution to this work - be it formal documentation or informal discussions. </p><p>The suggested CCF has been carefully designed to be conformant to the standard language technologies that are rapidly developing and penetrating the Internet communities. In this way we believe that the proposed CCF can contribute to a major leap in bridging between different technologies and products developed for AAC users and, more importantly, between these Assistive Technologies (AT) and the main-stream technologies of today's and tomorrow's networked information society. </p><p>The bridging approach also implies that the CCF is not intended to replace and exclude the use and development of current and future proprietary assistive technologies in the AAC field. Instead the CCF and its bridging technology and tools are designed to provide added value for all stake-holders; AAC users, special product developers and service providers, as well as general service and information providers who want to support improved accessibility to their products. </p><p>Designed to be used over the Internet for email, web-based activities, chat and/or other emerging Internet based services, the CCF technology can, however, be used by software manufacturers also to provide additional functionality, enhanced support for, and integration of, software and systems with multi-modal language features mainly intended for local use. </p><p>Although, this work is part of the EU funded WWAAC project, the concept coding work is to be kept open source as we want to collaborate with experts and stakeholders in both the AAC field and internet technologies/accessibility area. Thus we are wanting to use this area to establish an interest group in the concept coding approach. if you are interested in getting involved at whatever level then please contact us.</p><h2>Links</h2><p>These are some of the most relevant links i can think of to share, if you have others, please add them. </p><h3>research projects</h3><ul type=""circle""><li><a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.wwaac.eu/"">wwaac</a> project (the eu project that funded this initial work) </li></ul><blockquote><div align=""left""><ul><li>""<a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.wwaac.eu/products/Docs/D10_v10%20CoP.pdf"">Code ofPractice</a>"" -

"Dasher";"Dasher is an information-efficient text-entry interface, driven by natural continuous pointing gestures.";"<h2 class=""Heading"">From the authors:</h2><p>Dasher is a zooming interface. You point where you want to go, and the display zooms in wherever you point. The world into which you are zooming is painted with letters, so that any point you zoom in on corresponds to a piece of text. The more you zoom in, the longer the piece of text you have written. You choose what you write by choosing where to zoom. </p><p></p><p>To make the interface efficient, we use the predictions of a language model to determine how much of the world is devoted to each piece of text. Probable pieces of text are given more space, so they are quick and easy to select. Improbable pieces of text (for example, text with spelling mistakes) are given less space, so they are harder to write. The language model learns all the time: if you use a novel word once, it is easier to write next time. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>A big advantage of Dasher over other predictive text-entry interfaces that offer word-completions to the user is that it is <b>mode-free</b>: the user does not need to switch from a writing mode to an ""accept-model-predictions"" mode. </p><p>Another advantage is that it is easy to train the model on any writing style: simply load up an example file, then write away!</p><br /><h2 class=""Heading"">OATS Comment:</h2><p>Dasher is an amazing innovation on on-screen keyboards - although at first it might seem difficult, stick with it and you will be astounded at how efficient it is.  Although mainly aimed at users who can use a mouse (or similar device) the Dasher team are working on a switch accessible version.  There is also a version that works well with speech recognition software - <a title=""Speech Dasher"" href=""resolveuid/d8eeddfaf075fb166fb7a4b60529a52d"" target=""_self"">Speech Dasher</a>.<br /></p><h2 class=""Heading"">See Dasher in action:</h2><p>David MacKay demonstrated Dasher at the Bett 2006 Special Needs Fringe and you can <a href=""/web/20150424043338/http://www.l4l.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=76&amp;Itemid=1"" target=""_self"">watch the video</a> created by Leon Cych.Dasher 4.9.0 is now available for download from:</p><p> </p><p>  <a href=""/web/20150424043338/http://download.gnome.org/sources/dasher/4.9/"">http://download.gnome.org/sources/dasher/4.9/</a></p><p> </p><p>Windows binaries will shortly be available from:</p><p> </p><p> <a href=""/web/20150424043338/http://www.dasher.org.uk/Download.html"">http://www.dasher.org.uk/Download.html</a></p><p> </p><p>Dasher is a predictive text input system for the GNOME Desktop, suitable for any situation in which a conventional keyboard cannot be used.</p><p> </p><p>This is the first in a new development series, including a large number of improvements from a wide variety of contributors.

"eSpeak text to speech";"eSpeak is a compact free and open source software speech synthesizer for English and other languages, for Linux and Windows.";"<h2>From the developer:</h2><p> eSpeak uses a ""formant synthesis"" method.  This allows many languages to  be provided in a small size.  The speech is clear, and can be used at  high speeds, but is not as natural or smooth as larger synthesizers  which are based on human speech recordings. </p><p> eSpeak is available as: </p><ul><li>A command line program (Linux and Windows) to speak text from a file or from stdin.  </li><li>A shared library version for use by other programs. (On Windows this is a DLL). </li><li>A SAPI5 version for Windows, so it can be used with screen-readers and other programs that support the Windows SAPI5 interface. </li><li>eSpeak has been ported to other platforms, including Solaris and Mac OSX. </li></ul><h3>Features. </h3><ul><li>Includes different Voices, whose characteristics can be altered. </li><li>Can produce speech output as a WAV file. </li><li>SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) is supported (not complete), and also HTML. </li><li>Compact size.  The program and its data, including many languages, totals about 1.4 Mbytes. </li><li><b>Can be used as a front-end to MBROLA diphone voices,</b> see <a href=""/web/20150710182918/http://espeak.sourceforge.net/mbrola.html"">mbrola.html</a>. eSpeak converts text to phonemes with pitch and length information. </li><li>Can translate text into phoneme codes, so it could be adapted as a front end for another speech synthesis engine. </li><li>Potential for other languages. Several are included in varying  stages of progress. Help from native speakers for these or other  languages is welcome. </li><li>Development tools are available for producing and tuning phoneme data. </li></ul>";"contact_address-mailto:jonsd@users.sourceforge.net,project_home_page-http://espeak.sourceforge.net/";Text to Speech,General Tools,Communication,Accessing the Web,Alternative Access,Learning and Education,General Tools;http://espeak.sourceforge.net/download.html
"eStoryMaker";"A simple means for assembling text, picture and sound files into an e-story that supports multiple access means.";"<p> </p><p><b>eStoryMaker</b> is a simple program for assembling an e-story that affords multiple access methods. eStoryMaker can be used to e-book versions of your student's favorite children's books, to recap field trips or special events, to create multimedia social scripts, or to provide a multimedia accounting of each step in a task. eStoryMaker is also designed to work well with Launcher6. In spite of its name, you construct an e-story by placing text, picture and/or sound files in a folder along with the eStoryMaker.exe file. When you open eStoryMaker.exe, it loads page1.txt, page1.jpg and page1.wav (for example.) When your user asks for the next page, eStoryMaker loads the next set of files in the page sequence, if they exist. So, you have to name your picture files, record and name sound files, and create text files. You can use a clipboard text-to-speech program to read your story, if you don't want to bother with recording sound files.</p> <p>There are many freeware tools you can use to help create e-stories. To make e-books from children's books you can use a flatbed scanner, but I often just use a digital camera for quicker results. I take the books outside and shoot the pages in the shade to have good light, but no glare. For picture editing and renaming I recommend using the excellent and free IrfanView program easily obtained from the Internet. To record sound files I most often use the Sound Recorder accessory that comes with Windows. For more precise sound editing, and for converting wav to mp3 files I use the terrific free Audacity program. There are many better free, Internet available alternatives for creating text files than the default Windows Notepad. I have been using a program called EditPad that most importantly supports multiple files being open simultaneously (unlike Notepad.) Finally, I can recommend 2 freeware text-to-speech programs, Deskbot and SayzMe. Both are easily obtained on the Internet and use the freeware Microsoft Agent technology. I prefer Deskbot, and set its options to read the clipboard text only without any extra, distracting animations.</p>";"contact_address-mailto:jamjolu@hotmail.com,project_home_page-http://sites.google.com/site/jamjolu/Home/estorymaker";Educational and Learning,Learning and Education;http://sites.google.com/site/jamjolu/Home/downloads

It will cover a set of concepts covering the authorized Blissymbolics vocabulary of around 4450 Bliss-words. These will be organised in a Base Reference Ontology (BRO) with concepts covered by WordNet, and a Complementary Reference Ontology (CRO) for the rest. The Concept Coded concepts in the Reference Ontologies will be linked to an open ended numbers of so called Assistive Ontologies containing the different supported language representations for the concepts - Bliss being the first target for graphical symbol representations, and English and Swedish being the first natural language lexicons fully supported. The structure is already prepared for supporting a number of other symbolic representations, as well as all Scandinavian/Nordic, and a number of other European languages. More will be added as soon as interest and resources will be around. <br /></p><p>In technical terms; the first release will contain a Java based CCF Tool for browsing and managing the CCF resources (<a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://wordnet.princeton.edu/"">WordNet</a>, the BRO and CRO, Assistive Ontologies and symbol resources). The data will be stored in or retrieved from either a MySQL database or an RDF/XML based resource. <br /></p><p>The first practical implementation will be an updated version of the <a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.symbolnet.org/en/index.html"">SYMBERED</a> tool for creating symbol supported web content via a CMS module written in PHP working towards the MySQL database.

With the Bliss Think Tank in July'07 we've been busy hacking more demonstrators. Mats, Bengt and Lars have been busy fine-tuning the <a title=""Symbol &amp; Concept Coding Editor (aka SYMBERED)"" href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.oatsoft.org/Software/SymBeRed"">SYMBERED</a> system (CCF support for CMS - using PHP, MySQL, Java). I've been busy working on a .NET infrastructure and building a central CCF ontology in SQLServer. The database I've been working with is now populated with around 9000 concepts (based on the STANDUP project ontology) and around 3000 Bliss symbols (some of which are mapped to concept codes). There is an prototype asp.net website where you can search the ontologies, update the bliss-ccf mappings, write ruby annotated bliss messages (then you can copy the source to your own website like I've done below). This webservice could be used as a portal to manage the ccf, and more excitingly, for use by other software / web applications, e.g. <a title=""FoxySymbols"" href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.oatsoft.org/Software/foxysymbols"">FoxySymbols</a>. I hope to get the webservice &amp; database hosted soon.<br /></p><h2>Background</h2><p>Around the world, people with impaired communication, including difficulties to read or write, may use symbols as an alternative or complement to character based texts. Referencing to, and exchanging these alternatively coded messages over the Internet is difficult due to the lack of standardised encoding schemes and common practises. This site is intended to motivate, describe and promote the introduction and adoption of a common, open and vendor neutral Concept Coding Framework (CCF) to overcome some of these difficulties. In particular will act as a base for all contribution to this work - be it formal documentation or informal discussions. </p><p>The suggested CCF has been carefully designed to be conformant to the standard language technologies that are rapidly developing and penetrating the Internet communities. In this way we believe that the proposed CCF can contribute to a major leap in bridging between different technologies and products developed for AAC users and, more importantly, between these Assistive Technologies (AT) and the main-stream technologies of today's and tomorrow's networked information society. </p><p>The bridging approach also implies that the CCF is not intended to replace and exclude the use and development of current and future proprietary assistive technologies in the AAC field. Instead the CCF and its bridging technology and tools are designed to provide added value for all stake-holders; AAC users, special product developers and service providers, as well as general service and information providers who want to support improved accessibility to their products. </p><p>Designed to be used over the Internet for email, web-based activities, chat and/or other emerging Internet based services, the CCF technology can, however, be used by software manufacturers also to provide additional functionality, enhanced support for, and integration of, software and systems with multi-modal language features mainly intended for local use. </p><p>Although, this work is part of the EU funded WWAAC project, the concept coding work is to be kept open source as we want to collaborate with experts and stakeholders in both the AAC field and internet technologies/accessibility area. Thus we are wanting to use this area to establish an interest group in the concept coding approach. if you are interested in getting involved at whatever level then please contact us.</p><h2>Links</h2><p>These are some of the most relevant links i can think of to share, if you have others, please add them. </p><h3>research projects</h3><ul type=""circle""><li><a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.wwaac.eu/"">wwaac</a> project (the eu project that funded this initial work) </li></ul><blockquote><div align=""left""><ul><li>""<a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.wwaac.eu/products/Docs/D10_v10%20CoP.pdf"">Code ofPractice</a>"" -

"Dasher";"Dasher is an information-efficient text-entry interface, driven by natural continuous pointing gestures.";"<h2 class=""Heading"">From the authors:</h2><p>Dasher is a zooming interface. You point where you want to go, and the display zooms in wherever you point. The world into which you are zooming is painted with letters, so that any point you zoom in on corresponds to a piece of text. The more you zoom in, the longer the piece of text you have written. You choose what you write by choosing where to zoom. </p><p></p><p>To make the interface efficient, we use the predictions of a language model to determine how much of the world is devoted to each piece of text. Probable pieces of text are given more space, so they are quick and easy to select. Improbable pieces of text (for example, text with spelling mistakes) are given less space, so they are harder to write. The language model learns all the time: if you use a novel word once, it is easier to write next time. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>A big advantage of Dasher over other predictive text-entry interfaces that offer word-completions to the user is that it is <b>mode-free</b>: the user does not need to switch from a writing mode to an ""accept-model-predictions"" mode. </p><p>Another advantage is that it is easy to train the model on any writing style: simply load up an example file, then write away!</p><br /><h2 class=""Heading"">OATS Comment:</h2><p>Dasher is an amazing innovation on on-screen keyboards - although at first it might seem difficult, stick with it and you will be astounded at how efficient it is.  Although mainly aimed at users who can use a mouse (or similar device) the Dasher team are working on a switch accessible version.  There is also a version that works well with speech recognition software - <a title=""Speech Dasher"" href=""resolveuid/d8eeddfaf075fb166fb7a4b60529a52d"" target=""_self"">Speech Dasher</a>.<br /></p><h2 class=""Heading"">See Dasher in action:</h2><p>David MacKay demonstrated Dasher at the Bett 2006 Special Needs Fringe and you can <a href=""/web/20150424043338/http://www.l4l.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=76&amp;Itemid=1"" target=""_self"">watch the video</a> created by Leon Cych.Dasher 4.9.0 is now available for download from:</p><p> </p><p>  <a href=""/web/20150424043338/http://download.gnome.org/sources/dasher/4.9/"">http://download.gnome.org/sources/dasher/4.9/</a></p><p> </p><p>Windows binaries will shortly be available from:</p><p> </p><p> <a href=""/web/20150424043338/http://www.dasher.org.uk/Download.html"">http://www.dasher.org.uk/Download.html</a></p><p> </p><p>Dasher is a predictive text input system for the GNOME Desktop, suitable for any situation in which a conventional keyboard cannot be used.</p><p> </p><p>This is the first in a new development series, including a large number of improvements from a wide variety of contributors.

In the meantime, the invasiveness and resource consumption is minimal.<br />(DSpeech does not install itself, is very light, starts in a second and doesn't write anything to the registry). Some notable features of DSpeech are:<br /><br />1. Allows you to save the output as a .WAV or .MP3 file.<br />2. Allows you to quickly select different voices, even combine them, or juxtapose them in order to create dialogues between different voices.<br />3. DSpeech integrates a vocal recognition system that, through a simple script language, allows you to create interactive dialogues with the user.<br />4. Allows you to configure the voices in an independent way.<br />5. Thanks to apposite TAGs, it allows you to dynamically change the features of the voices during the playback (speed, volume and frequency), to insert pauses, emphasize specific words, or even to spell them out.<br />6. Allows you to capture and reproduce the content of the ClipBoard.<br />7. DSpeech is compatible with all vocal engines (SAPI 4-5 compliant).<br />8. AI dialog system. Not really useful, but amusing.

"eStoryMaker";"A simple means for assembling text, picture and sound files into an e-story that supports multiple access means.";"<p> </p><p><b>eStoryMaker</b> is a simple program for assembling an e-story that affords multiple access methods. eStoryMaker can be used to e-book versions of your student's favorite children's books, to recap field trips or special events, to create multimedia social scripts, or to provide a multimedia accounting of each step in a task. eStoryMaker is also designed to work well with Launcher6. In spite of its name, you construct an e-story by placing text, picture and/or sound files in a folder along with the eStoryMaker.exe file. When you open eStoryMaker.exe, it loads page1.txt, page1.jpg and page1.wav (for example.) When your user asks for the next page, eStoryMaker loads the next set of files in the page sequence, if they exist. So, you have to name your picture files, record and name sound files, and create text files. You can use a clipboard text-to-speech program to read your story, if you don't want to bother with recording sound files.</p> <p>There are many freeware tools you can use to help create e-stories. To make e-books from children's books you can use a flatbed scanner, but I often just use a digital camera for quicker results. I take the books outside and shoot the pages in the shade to have good light, but no glare. For picture editing and renaming I recommend using the excellent and free IrfanView program easily obtained from the Internet. To record sound files I most often use the Sound Recorder accessory that comes with Windows. For more precise sound editing, and for converting wav to mp3 files I use the terrific free Audacity program. There are many better free, Internet available alternatives for creating text files than the default Windows Notepad. I have been using a program called EditPad that most importantly supports multiple files being open simultaneously (unlike Notepad.) Finally, I can recommend 2 freeware text-to-speech programs, Deskbot and SayzMe. Both are easily obtained on the Internet and use the freeware Microsoft Agent technology. I prefer Deskbot, and set its options to read the clipboard text only without any extra, distracting animations.</p>";"contact_address-mailto:jamjolu@hotmail.com,project_home_page-http://sites.google.com/site/jamjolu/Home/estorymaker";Educational and Learning,Learning and Education;http://sites.google.com/site/jamjolu/Home/downloads

Launcher6 covers the screen providing users with a restricted environment, allowing choices, but reducing the probability that the user will access the usual, and perhaps troublesome, Windows interface. It supports access using single switch, two switch, Intellikeys, touch screen and mouse methods. Facilitators can configure the six cells on the launcher6 screen using the built-in editor. Launcher6 continually saves this 'setup' as changes occur in a text file that ends with a '.ls6' extention. Each cell within a setup can be assigned the following:</p> <p>1. A graphic element of types: '.bmp', '.jpg', '.gif' (animation is ok), or '.png'.</p> <p>2. A cue either as a sound file or as text to be spoken via a clipboard text to speech utility.</p> <p>3. A message in the same way as the cue.</p> <p>4. A registered filetype or a program to open.</p> <p>5. A link to another launcher6 setup.</p> <p>6. An action: hide me, show all, quit, or none.</p> <p>When launcher6 starts it always loads the settings saved in the file ""main.ls6"". From the ""main"" setup you can link to other setups. The ""main.ls6"" setup must be in the same directory as the ""launcher6.exe"" program file.</p> <b></b><p><b>Launcher6 has support for the following access methods</b>:</p> <p>Mouse or touchscreen</p> <p>Don Johsnton (or equivalent) switch interface</p> <p>keyboard devices (like Intellikeys)</p> <b></b><p><b>Launcher6 responds to the following keys</b>:</p> <b></b><p><b>@</b> = Disable/Enable the following keyboard commands, enabled by default.</p> <b></b><p><b>0</b> = Start/Stop autoscan</p> <b></b><p><b>1</b> = Highlight the next cell for 2 switch scan</p> <b></b><p><b>2</b> = Select highlighted item for 2 switch scan</p> <b></b><p><b>3</b> = Spin selects a random cell</p> <b></b><p><b>q</b> = quit launcher6</p> <b></b><p><b>e</b> = edit</p> <b></b><p><b>z</b> = resize screen smaller</p> <b></b><p><b>f</b> = resize screen to full screen dimensions</p> <b></b><p><b>t,y,u,i,o,p</b> = direct access to cells 1,2,3,4,5,6 respectively in left to right, top to bottom order.</p> <b></b><p><b>h</b> = help</p> <b></b><p><b>m</b> = Go to the ""main.ls6"" setup</p> <p>If <b><i>Use Mouse Scan</i></b> is set to true in the editor Launcher6 will use left mouse click to start and stop scanning.</p> <b><p>General Settings:</p> </b><p>The following settings at the bottom of the Editor (type <b><i>e</i></b> from the lauuncher6 screen.)</p> <b></b><p><b>Scan Rate</b>:</p> <p>Set the scan rate in seconds for single switch scanners.</p> <b></b><p><b>Get/Name Setup</b>:</p> <p>You can either save the current setup under a new name, or load a previously saved setup. For convenience, keep all the setup files (*.ls6 files) in the same folder as launcher6.exe. Unfortunately, if you move launcher6 to another computer, the links to various resources are not likely to work, and you may need to rebuild your setups. It is a good idea to save a blank, or partially completed common setup that you can use as a template for new named setups to reduce work.</p> <b></b><p><b>How to build a new setup and set links to it</b>:</p> <p>1. Open the editor (type 'e' while in the launcher6 screen) and use the Get/Name Setup button to name a new setup.</p> <p>2. Edit the cells on the newly named setup.</p> <p>3. Open other setup(s) and edit cell links to the newly named setup as desired.</p> <b></b><p><b>Use Mouse Scan</b>:</p> <p>If set to true, the left mouse click will initiate an auto (single switch scan) scan in the launcher screen.</p> <b></b><p><b>Speech Output</b>:</p> <p>Choose either Use Sound Files or Use Clipboard Text to Speech.</p> <p>If you choose sound files, then the definitions for Cues and Messages should be paths to sound files.</p> <p>If you choose text-to-speech, then the cues and messages are defined as simple text. Text-to- speech is provided by an external program that converts text sent to the 'clipboard' to speech sounds. The programs ""SayzMe"" or ""DeskBot"" are good choices. Both programs are easily obtained on the Internet, and both require the Microsoft Agent to be installed. As a convenience, specify a cell on the main setup, or some other setup that launches your preferred clipboard text-to-speech utility. Or, launch your text-to-speech utility at startup. Make sure you turn off unnecessary sounds or character animations that may detract from a clear auditory scan. Refer to the settings of those programs for selecting voices.</p> <p>Ã‚Â </p> <b></b><p><b>Editing Cell Settings: </b></p> <p>Type <b><i>e</i></b> from launcher6 to open editor.</p> <b></b><p><b>Editing Cell</b>:</p> <p>This box indicates which of the six launcher6 cells setup details are shown. Use the up and dn buttons to change which cell is referenced.</p> <b></b><p><b>Set Pic</b>:</p> <p>This button asks you to locate a picture file for the cell indicated in the ""Editing Cell"" box above. Avoid using pictures that have large invisible areas that may make it difficult for mouse or touscreen users to select.</p> <b></b><p><b>Set Cue</b>:</p> <p>This button asks you to either locate a sound file for an auditory scanning cue, or to enter some text if Use Clipboard Speech has been selected (See General Settings).</p> <b></b><p><b>Set Message</b>:</p> <p>This button asks you to either locate a sound file for a message when the cell is selected, or to enter some text if Use Clipboard Speech (See General Settings).</p> <b></b><p><b>Find a File to Open</b>:</p> <p>This button asks you to find a program to launch, or registered file to open. Most executable program files will launch without problems. However, with registered filetypes Launcher6 edits the filepath to make it compatible with DOS. This means file and folder names will be truncated to adhere to the DOS 8.3 format. Filenames longer than 8 letters will be reduced to 6 letters followed by '~1'. Spaces in names are not allowed. This option doesn't always work. If after attempting to open your choice with the <b><i>Test It</i></b> button (which always gives you a little lecture) it doesn't open, move your target file to another location, or rename it, and try again. </p> <p>You can identify either a file to open, or identify another launcher6 setup to load as described next, but not both.</p> <b></b><p><b>Set Link to Another Launcher Page</b>:</p> <p>This button asks you to identify another launcher6 setup file (somefile.ls6) to load. </p> <p>You can identify either a file to open as described above, or another launcher6 setup, but not both.</p> <b></b><p><b>Define Action</b>:</p> <p>This button asks you to select from the following actions:</p> <b><i></i></b><p><b><i>Hide me</i></b> --- hides the target button when selected</p> <b><i></i></b><p><b><i>Show all</i></b> --- Show all hidden buttons</p> <b><i></i></b><p><b><i>End Session</i></b> --- Closes launcher6</p> <b><i></i></b><p><b><i>None</i></b> ---- Does nothing, and is the default action</p> <p>The 'hide me' action can be used to allow a target cell to be used only once per session.</p>";"help-http://www.oatsoft.org/Software/launcher6/help,contact_address-mailto:jamjolu@hotmail.com,project_home_page-http://sites.google.com/site/jamjolu/Home/launcher6";Educational and Learning,Alternative Access;http://sites.google.com/site/jamjolu/Home/launcher6

"Click-N-Type virtual keyboard";"Click-N-Type is an on-screen virtual keyboard, giving access to the keyboard characters through the use of your mouse or other pointing device.";"<h2 class=""Heading"">From the authors:</h2><br /><p>Click-N-Type is an on-screen keyboard which allows you to type with the use of a pointing device (e.g. mouse or tracker ball) rather than the physical computer keyboard. The designers claim it is successful in allowing text to be typed into “those uncooperative places like browser URL ""Address:"" fields, Email ""To:"" addresses, Email ""Subject:"" fields, and dialog boxes like ""Open"" and ""Save As..."",” which other virtual keyboards have trouble with. Several custom layouts are available, including QWERTY, ABC and ‘Speed layout’ in which the letters commonly used together are grouped together, reducing the pointer motion required. An English language prediction program is also available for use with the keyboard, available from the same website. </p> <h2 class=""Heading"">OATS Comments:</h2><p>This is a flexible and powerful on-screen keyboard.  To customise the keyboards you will need to be fairly computer literate, but other than that it is also quite easy to use.  It includes basic word prediction.<br /></p><p><br /></p>";"help-http://www.oatsoft.org/Software/Click-N-TypeVirtualKeyboard/help,contact_address-mailto:cnt@lakefolks.com,project_home_page-http://www.lakefolks.org/cnt";On Screen Keyboard Projects,Text input Projects,Alternative Access;http://www.lakefolks.org/cnt/#Download
"Concept Coding Framework (CCF)";"Around the world, people with impaired communication, including difficulties to read or write, may use symbols as an alternative or complement to character based texts. Referencing to, and exchanging these alternatively coded messages over the Internet is difficult due to the lack of standardised encoding schemes and common practises.

More to appear here soon after the recent move of the server home of OATS, as well as for the conceptcoding.org domain. More to come - soon hopefully ...</p><br /><h3>3 September 2009 - (Mats Lundälv)</h3><p>The summer has passed and the work towards the first CCF release is slowly progressing. Will we make it during the 3rd quarter of 2009 as envisaged ? Well - surprise - possibly not :-/ It currently looks uncertain whether we will be ready during this month. It will probably be a bit later this autumn. <br /></p><p>Bengt Farre's completely re-written new SYMBERED version is getting close to completion, but still has some way to go.</p><p>The good news is that Lars Nordberg is well on the way to transfer our CCF databases from MySQL to the <a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://developers.sun.com/javadb/"">Sun JavaDB</a> (based on <a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://db.apache.org/derby/"">Apache Derby</a>) Java database.

It will cover a set of concepts covering the authorized Blissymbolics vocabulary of around 4450 Bliss-words. These will be organised in a Base Reference Ontology (BRO) with concepts covered by WordNet, and a Complementary Reference Ontology (CRO) for the rest. The Concept Coded concepts in the Reference Ontologies will be linked to an open ended numbers of so called Assistive Ontologies containing the different supported language representations for the concepts - Bliss being the first target for graphical symbol representations, and English and Swedish being the first natural language lexicons fully supported. The structure is already prepared for supporting a number of other symbolic representations, as well as all Scandinavian/Nordic, and a number of other European languages. More will be added as soon as interest and resources will be around. <br /></p><p>In technical terms; the first release will contain a Java based CCF Tool for browsing and managing the CCF resources (<a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://wordnet.princeton.edu/"">WordNet</a>, the BRO and CRO, Assistive Ontologies and symbol resources). The data will be stored in or retrieved from either a MySQL database or an RDF/XML based resource. <br /></p><p>The first practical implementation will be an updated version of the <a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.symbolnet.org/en/index.html"">SYMBERED</a> tool for creating symbol supported web content via a CMS module written in PHP working towards the MySQL database. (This will be a complete re-write of the first SYMBERED version based on the <a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.papunet.net/"">Papunet </a>CMS). </p><p>The next practical implementation will be the first prototypes of the envisaged CCF symbol support plugin extension for OpenOffice.org within the AEGIS project - planned for the 4th quarter of 2009.<br /></p><h3>08 June 2009 - (Mats Lundälv)</h3><p>In the AEGIS project 1:st international workshop (in Slough at RIM 05 June) Dr. Christian Galinski from <a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.infoterm.info/"">Infoterm </a>gave a very interesting and informative presentation on issues concerning ""Standards for content in the field of eInclusion - and beyond"" - with great relevance for the CCF work in particular, and for the <a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.aegis-project.eu/"">AEGIS </a>and <a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.raisingthefloor.net/"">Raising The Floor</a> projects in general.

With the Bliss Think Tank in July'07 we've been busy hacking more demonstrators. Mats, Bengt and Lars have been busy fine-tuning the <a title=""Symbol &amp; Concept Coding Editor (aka SYMBERED)"" href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.oatsoft.org/Software/SymBeRed"">SYMBERED</a> system (CCF support for CMS - using PHP, MySQL, Java). I've been busy working on a .NET infrastructure and building a central CCF ontology in SQLServer. The database I've been working with is now populated with around 9000 concepts (based on the STANDUP project ontology) and around 3000 Bliss symbols (some of which are mapped to concept codes). There is an prototype asp.net website where you can search the ontologies, update the bliss-ccf mappings, write ruby annotated bliss messages (then you can copy the source to your own website like I've done below). This webservice could be used as a portal to manage the ccf, and more excitingly, for use by other software / web applications, e.g. <a title=""FoxySymbols"" href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.oatsoft.org/Software/foxysymbols"">FoxySymbols</a>. I hope to get the webservice &amp; database hosted soon.<br /></p><h2>Background</h2><p>Around the world, people with impaired communication, including difficulties to read or write, may use symbols as an alternative or complement to character based texts. Referencing to, and exchanging these alternatively coded messages over the Internet is difficult due to the lack of standardised encoding schemes and common practises. This site is intended to motivate, describe and promote the introduction and adoption of a common, open and vendor neutral Concept Coding Framework (CCF) to overcome some of these difficulties. In particular will act as a base for all contribution to this work - be it formal documentation or informal discussions. </p><p>The suggested CCF has been carefully designed to be conformant to the standard language technologies that are rapidly developing and penetrating the Internet communities. In this way we believe that the proposed CCF can contribute to a major leap in bridging between different technologies and products developed for AAC users and, more importantly, between these Assistive Technologies (AT) and the main-stream technologies of today's and tomorrow's networked information society. </p><p>The bridging approach also implies that the CCF is not intended to replace and exclude the use and development of current and future proprietary assistive technologies in the AAC field. Instead the CCF and its bridging technology and tools are designed to provide added value for all stake-holders; AAC users, special product developers and service providers, as well as general service and information providers who want to support improved accessibility to their products. </p><p>Designed to be used over the Internet for email, web-based activities, chat and/or other emerging Internet based services, the CCF technology can, however, be used by software manufacturers also to provide additional functionality, enhanced support for, and integration of, software and systems with multi-modal language features mainly intended for local use. </p><p>Although, this work is part of the EU funded WWAAC project, the concept coding work is to be kept open source as we want to collaborate with experts and stakeholders in both the AAC field and internet technologies/accessibility area. Thus we are wanting to use this area to establish an interest group in the concept coding approach. if you are interested in getting involved at whatever level then please contact us.</p><h2>Links</h2><p>These are some of the most relevant links i can think of to share, if you have others, please add them. </p><h3>research projects</h3><ul type=""circle""><li><a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.wwaac.eu/"">wwaac</a> project (the eu project that funded this initial work) </li></ul><blockquote><div align=""left""><ul><li>""<a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.wwaac.eu/products/Docs/D10_v10%20CoP.pdf"">Code ofPractice</a>"" -

"Dasher";"Dasher is an information-efficient text-entry interface, driven by natural continuous pointing gestures.";"<h2 class=""Heading"">From the authors:</h2><p>Dasher is a zooming interface. You point where you want to go, and the display zooms in wherever you point. The world into which you are zooming is painted with letters, so that any point you zoom in on corresponds to a piece of text. The more you zoom in, the longer the piece of text you have written. You choose what you write by choosing where to zoom. </p><p></p><p>To make the interface efficient, we use the predictions of a language model to determine how much of the world is devoted to each piece of text. Probable pieces of text are given more space, so they are quick and easy to select. Improbable pieces of text (for example, text with spelling mistakes) are given less space, so they are harder to write. The language model learns all the time: if you use a novel word once, it is easier to write next time. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>A big advantage of Dasher over other predictive text-entry interfaces that offer word-completions to the user is that it is <b>mode-free</b>: the user does not need to switch from a writing mode to an ""accept-model-predictions"" mode. </p><p>Another advantage is that it is easy to train the model on any writing style: simply load up an example file, then write away!</p><br /><h2 class=""Heading"">OATS Comment:</h2><p>Dasher is an amazing innovation on on-screen keyboards - although at first it might seem difficult, stick with it and you will be astounded at how efficient it is.  Although mainly aimed at users who can use a mouse (or similar device) the Dasher team are working on a switch accessible version.  There is also a version that works well with speech recognition software - <a title=""Speech Dasher"" href=""resolveuid/d8eeddfaf075fb166fb7a4b60529a52d"" target=""_self"">Speech Dasher</a>.<br /></p><h2 class=""Heading"">See Dasher in action:</h2><p>David MacKay demonstrated Dasher at the Bett 2006 Special Needs Fringe and you can <a href=""/web/20150424043338/http://www.l4l.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=76&amp;Itemid=1"" target=""_self"">watch the video</a> created by Leon Cych.Dasher 4.9.0 is now available for download from:</p><p> </p><p>  <a href=""/web/20150424043338/http://download.gnome.org/sources/dasher/4.9/"">http://download.gnome.org/sources/dasher/4.9/</a></p><p> </p><p>Windows binaries will shortly be available from:</p><p> </p><p> <a href=""/web/20150424043338/http://www.dasher.org.uk/Download.html"">http://www.dasher.org.uk/Download.html</a></p><p> </p><p>Dasher is a predictive text input system for the GNOME Desktop, suitable for any situation in which a conventional keyboard cannot be used.</p><p> </p><p>This is the first in a new development series, including a large number of improvements from a wide variety of contributors.

With the touch of the ""Enter"" key or a mouse click, the text is converted to speech and sent to a voice synthesizer which conveys the message in mellifluous tones. Audio phrases are played as recorded.";"<h3>From the Authors:</h3><p>E-triloquist, the personal computer augmentative communication aid software formerly known as ""SpeakEasy"", developed as a family project.  Dad had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  (ALS) and lost his ability to speak in the course of the disease.  Son is  particularly versatile in personal computers.  Our first version (named ""SpeakEasy"" at the time) was made available on the Internet in early 1995.  We are now on Version 5.7 with even more new features suggested by current users of the program, and with full support for Windows-ME and Windows-XP operating systems. See the <a href=""/web/20140203203117/http://www.etriloquist.com/NewFeatures.html"">New Features</a> page for full details on the enhancements in V5.7.  Go to the <a href=""/web/20140203203117/http://www.etriloquist.com/Downloads.php"">Downloads</a> page to install or upgrade to the latest version of E-triloquist. </p><p> Most users of the program can still use a keyboard, albeit slowly.   For those who can no longer type, E-triloquist can easily be teamed-up with on-screen  keyboards, scanners, word-predictors, single-switch input, or other assistive input devices such as  <a href=""/web/20140203203117/http://www.lakefolks.org/cnt/"">Click-N-Type virtual keyboard</a> from Lake Software, <a href=""/web/20140203203117/http://www.orin.com/access/softype/index.htm"">SofType</a> from <a href=""/web/20140203203117/http://www.orin.com/"">Origin Instruments</a>, <a href=""/web/20140203203117/http://www.wivik.com/"">WiViK®</a> on-screen keyboard (virtual keyboard) software,  <a href=""/web/20140203203117/http://march-of-faces.org/resources/vkt.html"">Virtual On-Screen Keyboard</a> by <a href=""/web/20140203203117/http://march-of-faces.org/resources/vkt.html"">MiloSoft</a>, <a href=""/web/20140203203117/http://www.imgpresents.com/"">My-T-Mouse</a> from <a href=""/web/20140203203117/http://www.imgpresents.com/"">IMG</a>, and a variety of input devices and augmentative communication products from <a href=""/web/20140203203117/http://www.prentrom.com/"">Prentke Romich Company</a>.

This allows many languages to  be provided in a small size.  The speech is clear, and can be used at  high speeds, but is not as natural or smooth as larger synthesizers  which are based on human speech recordings. </p><p> eSpeak is available as: </p><ul><li>A command line program (Linux and Windows) to speak text from a file or from stdin.  </li><li>A shared library version for use by other programs. (On Windows this is a DLL). </li><li>A SAPI5 version for Windows, so it can be used with screen-readers and other programs that support the Windows SAPI5 interface. </li><li>eSpeak has been ported to other platforms, including Solaris and Mac OSX. </li></ul><h3>Features. </h3><ul><li>Includes different Voices, whose characteristics can be altered. </li><li>Can produce speech output as a WAV file. </li><li>SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) is supported (not complete), and also HTML. </li><li>Compact size.

"eStoryMaker";"A simple means for assembling text, picture and sound files into an e-story that supports multiple access means.";"<p> </p><p><b>eStoryMaker</b> is a simple program for assembling an e-story that affords multiple access methods. eStoryMaker can be used to e-book versions of your student's favorite children's books, to recap field trips or special events, to create multimedia social scripts, or to provide a multimedia accounting of each step in a task. eStoryMaker is also designed to work well with Launcher6. In spite of its name, you construct an e-story by placing text, picture and/or sound files in a folder along with the eStoryMaker.exe file. When you open eStoryMaker.exe, it loads page1.txt, page1.jpg and page1.wav (for example.) When your user asks for the next page, eStoryMaker loads the next set of files in the page sequence, if they exist. So, you have to name your picture files, record and name sound files, and create text files. You can use a clipboard text-to-speech program to read your story, if you don't want to bother with recording sound files.</p> <p>There are many freeware tools you can use to help create e-stories. To make e-books from children's books you can use a flatbed scanner, but I often just use a digital camera for quicker results. I take the books outside and shoot the pages in the shade to have good light, but no glare. For picture editing and renaming I recommend using the excellent and free IrfanView program easily obtained from the Internet. To record sound files I most often use the Sound Recorder accessory that comes with Windows. For more precise sound editing, and for converting wav to mp3 files I use the terrific free Audacity program. There are many better free, Internet available alternatives for creating text files than the default Windows Notepad. I have been using a program called EditPad that most importantly supports multiple files being open simultaneously (unlike Notepad.) Finally, I can recommend 2 freeware text-to-speech programs, Deskbot and SayzMe. Both are easily obtained on the Internet and use the freeware Microsoft Agent technology. I prefer Deskbot, and set its options to read the clipboard text only without any extra, distracting animations.</p>";"contact_address-mailto:jamjolu@hotmail.com,project_home_page-http://sites.google.com/site/jamjolu/Home/estorymaker";Educational and Learning,Learning and Education;http://sites.google.com/site/jamjolu/Home/downloads

It will cover a set of concepts covering the authorized Blissymbolics vocabulary of around 4450 Bliss-words. These will be organised in a Base Reference Ontology (BRO) with concepts covered by WordNet, and a Complementary Reference Ontology (CRO) for the rest. The Concept Coded concepts in the Reference Ontologies will be linked to an open ended numbers of so called Assistive Ontologies containing the different supported language representations for the concepts - Bliss being the first target for graphical symbol representations, and English and Swedish being the first natural language lexicons fully supported. The structure is already prepared for supporting a number of other symbolic representations, as well as all Scandinavian/Nordic, and a number of other European languages. More will be added as soon as interest and resources will be around. <br /></p><p>In technical terms; the first release will contain a Java based CCF Tool for browsing and managing the CCF resources (<a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://wordnet.princeton.edu/"">WordNet</a>, the BRO and CRO, Assistive Ontologies and symbol resources). The data will be stored in or retrieved from either a MySQL database or an RDF/XML based resource. <br /></p><p>The first practical implementation will be an updated version of the <a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.symbolnet.org/en/index.html"">SYMBERED</a> tool for creating symbol supported web content via a CMS module written in PHP working towards the MySQL database.

With the Bliss Think Tank in July'07 we've been busy hacking more demonstrators. Mats, Bengt and Lars have been busy fine-tuning the <a title=""Symbol &amp; Concept Coding Editor (aka SYMBERED)"" href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.oatsoft.org/Software/SymBeRed"">SYMBERED</a> system (CCF support for CMS - using PHP, MySQL, Java). I've been busy working on a .NET infrastructure and building a central CCF ontology in SQLServer. The database I've been working with is now populated with around 9000 concepts (based on the STANDUP project ontology) and around 3000 Bliss symbols (some of which are mapped to concept codes). There is an prototype asp.net website where you can search the ontologies, update the bliss-ccf mappings, write ruby annotated bliss messages (then you can copy the source to your own website like I've done below). This webservice could be used as a portal to manage the ccf, and more excitingly, for use by other software / web applications, e.g. <a title=""FoxySymbols"" href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.oatsoft.org/Software/foxysymbols"">FoxySymbols</a>. I hope to get the webservice &amp; database hosted soon.<br /></p><h2>Background</h2><p>Around the world, people with impaired communication, including difficulties to read or write, may use symbols as an alternative or complement to character based texts. Referencing to, and exchanging these alternatively coded messages over the Internet is difficult due to the lack of standardised encoding schemes and common practises. This site is intended to motivate, describe and promote the introduction and adoption of a common, open and vendor neutral Concept Coding Framework (CCF) to overcome some of these difficulties. In particular will act as a base for all contribution to this work - be it formal documentation or informal discussions. </p><p>The suggested CCF has been carefully designed to be conformant to the standard language technologies that are rapidly developing and penetrating the Internet communities. In this way we believe that the proposed CCF can contribute to a major leap in bridging between different technologies and products developed for AAC users and, more importantly, between these Assistive Technologies (AT) and the main-stream technologies of today's and tomorrow's networked information society. </p><p>The bridging approach also implies that the CCF is not intended to replace and exclude the use and development of current and future proprietary assistive technologies in the AAC field. Instead the CCF and its bridging technology and tools are designed to provide added value for all stake-holders; AAC users, special product developers and service providers, as well as general service and information providers who want to support improved accessibility to their products. </p><p>Designed to be used over the Internet for email, web-based activities, chat and/or other emerging Internet based services, the CCF technology can, however, be used by software manufacturers also to provide additional functionality, enhanced support for, and integration of, software and systems with multi-modal language features mainly intended for local use. </p><p>Although, this work is part of the EU funded WWAAC project, the concept coding work is to be kept open source as we want to collaborate with experts and stakeholders in both the AAC field and internet technologies/accessibility area. Thus we are wanting to use this area to establish an interest group in the concept coding approach. if you are interested in getting involved at whatever level then please contact us.</p><h2>Links</h2><p>These are some of the most relevant links i can think of to share, if you have others, please add them. </p><h3>research projects</h3><ul type=""circle""><li><a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.wwaac.eu/"">wwaac</a> project (the eu project that funded this initial work) </li></ul><blockquote><div align=""left""><ul><li>""<a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.wwaac.eu/products/Docs/D10_v10%20CoP.pdf"">Code ofPractice</a>"" -

"Dasher";"Dasher is an information-efficient text-entry interface, driven by natural continuous pointing gestures.";"<h2 class=""Heading"">From the authors:</h2><p>Dasher is a zooming interface. You point where you want to go, and the display zooms in wherever you point. The world into which you are zooming is painted with letters, so that any point you zoom in on corresponds to a piece of text. The more you zoom in, the longer the piece of text you have written. You choose what you write by choosing where to zoom. </p><p></p><p>To make the interface efficient, we use the predictions of a language model to determine how much of the world is devoted to each piece of text. Probable pieces of text are given more space, so they are quick and easy to select. Improbable pieces of text (for example, text with spelling mistakes) are given less space, so they are harder to write. The language model learns all the time: if you use a novel word once, it is easier to write next time. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>A big advantage of Dasher over other predictive text-entry interfaces that offer word-completions to the user is that it is <b>mode-free</b>: the user does not need to switch from a writing mode to an ""accept-model-predictions"" mode. </p><p>Another advantage is that it is easy to train the model on any writing style: simply load up an example file, then write away!</p><br /><h2 class=""Heading"">OATS Comment:</h2><p>Dasher is an amazing innovation on on-screen keyboards - although at first it might seem difficult, stick with it and you will be astounded at how efficient it is.  Although mainly aimed at users who can use a mouse (or similar device) the Dasher team are working on a switch accessible version.  There is also a version that works well with speech recognition software - <a title=""Speech Dasher"" href=""resolveuid/d8eeddfaf075fb166fb7a4b60529a52d"" target=""_self"">Speech Dasher</a>.<br /></p><h2 class=""Heading"">See Dasher in action:</h2><p>David MacKay demonstrated Dasher at the Bett 2006 Special Needs Fringe and you can <a href=""/web/20150424043338/http://www.l4l.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=76&amp;Itemid=1"" target=""_self"">watch the video</a> created by Leon Cych.Dasher 4.9.0 is now available for download from:</p><p> </p><p>  <a href=""/web/20150424043338/http://download.gnome.org/sources/dasher/4.9/"">http://download.gnome.org/sources/dasher/4.9/</a></p><p> </p><p>Windows binaries will shortly be available from:</p><p> </p><p> <a href=""/web/20150424043338/http://www.dasher.org.uk/Download.html"">http://www.dasher.org.uk/Download.html</a></p><p> </p><p>Dasher is a predictive text input system for the GNOME Desktop, suitable for any situation in which a conventional keyboard cannot be used.</p><p> </p><p>This is the first in a new development series, including a large number of improvements from a wide variety of contributors.

In the meantime, the invasiveness and resource consumption is minimal.<br />(DSpeech does not install itself, is very light, starts in a second and doesn't write anything to the registry). Some notable features of DSpeech are:<br /><br />1. Allows you to save the output as a .WAV or .MP3 file.<br />2. Allows you to quickly select different voices, even combine them, or juxtapose them in order to create dialogues between different voices.<br />3. DSpeech integrates a vocal recognition system that, through a simple script language, allows you to create interactive dialogues with the user.<br />4. Allows you to configure the voices in an independent way.<br />5. Thanks to apposite TAGs, it allows you to dynamically change the features of the voices during the playback (speed, volume and frequency), to insert pauses, emphasize specific words, or even to spell them out.<br />6. Allows you to capture and reproduce the content of the ClipBoard.<br />7. DSpeech is compatible with all vocal engines (SAPI 4-5 compliant).<br />8. AI dialog system. Not really useful, but amusing.

"eStoryMaker";"A simple means for assembling text, picture and sound files into an e-story that supports multiple access means.";"<p> </p><p><b>eStoryMaker</b> is a simple program for assembling an e-story that affords multiple access methods. eStoryMaker can be used to e-book versions of your student's favorite children's books, to recap field trips or special events, to create multimedia social scripts, or to provide a multimedia accounting of each step in a task. eStoryMaker is also designed to work well with Launcher6. In spite of its name, you construct an e-story by placing text, picture and/or sound files in a folder along with the eStoryMaker.exe file. When you open eStoryMaker.exe, it loads page1.txt, page1.jpg and page1.wav (for example.) When your user asks for the next page, eStoryMaker loads the next set of files in the page sequence, if they exist. So, you have to name your picture files, record and name sound files, and create text files. You can use a clipboard text-to-speech program to read your story, if you don't want to bother with recording sound files.</p> <p>There are many freeware tools you can use to help create e-stories. To make e-books from children's books you can use a flatbed scanner, but I often just use a digital camera for quicker results. I take the books outside and shoot the pages in the shade to have good light, but no glare. For picture editing and renaming I recommend using the excellent and free IrfanView program easily obtained from the Internet. To record sound files I most often use the Sound Recorder accessory that comes with Windows. For more precise sound editing, and for converting wav to mp3 files I use the terrific free Audacity program. There are many better free, Internet available alternatives for creating text files than the default Windows Notepad. I have been using a program called EditPad that most importantly supports multiple files being open simultaneously (unlike Notepad.) Finally, I can recommend 2 freeware text-to-speech programs, Deskbot and SayzMe. Both are easily obtained on the Internet and use the freeware Microsoft Agent technology. I prefer Deskbot, and set its options to read the clipboard text only without any extra, distracting animations.</p>";"contact_address-mailto:jamjolu@hotmail.com,project_home_page-http://sites.google.com/site/jamjolu/Home/estorymaker";Educational and Learning,Learning and Education;http://sites.google.com/site/jamjolu/Home/downloads

"AutoIT";"AutoIt v3 is a freeware BASIC-like scripting language designed for automating the Windows GUI and general scripting.  It uses a combination of simulated keystrokes, mouse movement and window/control manipulation in order to automate tasks in a way not possible or reliable with other languages (e.g. VBScript and SendKeys).  AutoIt is also very small, self-contained and will run on 95, 98, ME, NT4, 2000, XP, 2003 out of the box with no annoying ""runtimes"" required!

"Click-N-Type virtual keyboard";"Click-N-Type is an on-screen virtual keyboard, giving access to the keyboard characters through the use of your mouse or other pointing device.";"<h2 class=""Heading"">From the authors:</h2><br /><p>Click-N-Type is an on-screen keyboard which allows you to type with the use of a pointing device (e.g. mouse or tracker ball) rather than the physical computer keyboard. The designers claim it is successful in allowing text to be typed into “those uncooperative places like browser URL ""Address:"" fields, Email ""To:"" addresses, Email ""Subject:"" fields, and dialog boxes like ""Open"" and ""Save As..."",” which other virtual keyboards have trouble with. Several custom layouts are available, including QWERTY, ABC and ‘Speed layout’ in which the letters commonly used together are grouped together, reducing the pointer motion required. An English language prediction program is also available for use with the keyboard, available from the same website. </p> <h2 class=""Heading"">OATS Comments:</h2><p>This is a flexible and powerful on-screen keyboard.  To customise the keyboards you will need to be fairly computer literate, but other than that it is also quite easy to use.  It includes basic word prediction.<br /></p><p><br /></p>";"help-http://www.oatsoft.org/Software/Click-N-TypeVirtualKeyboard/help,contact_address-mailto:cnt@lakefolks.com,project_home_page-http://www.lakefolks.org/cnt";On Screen Keyboard Projects,Text input Projects,Alternative Access;http://www.lakefolks.org/cnt/#Download

More to appear here soon after the recent move of the server home of OATS, as well as for the conceptcoding.org domain. More to come - soon hopefully ...</p><br /><h3>3 September 2009 - (Mats Lundälv)</h3><p>The summer has passed and the work towards the first CCF release is slowly progressing. Will we make it during the 3rd quarter of 2009 as envisaged ? Well - surprise - possibly not :-/ It currently looks uncertain whether we will be ready during this month.

It will cover a set of concepts covering the authorized Blissymbolics vocabulary of around 4450 Bliss-words. These will be organised in a Base Reference Ontology (BRO) with concepts covered by WordNet, and a Complementary Reference Ontology (CRO) for the rest. The Concept Coded concepts in the Reference Ontologies will be linked to an open ended numbers of so called Assistive Ontologies containing the different supported language representations for the concepts - Bliss being the first target for graphical symbol representations, and English and Swedish being the first natural language lexicons fully supported. The structure is already prepared for supporting a number of other symbolic representations, as well as all Scandinavian/Nordic, and a number of other European languages. More will be added as soon as interest and resources will be around. <br /></p><p>In technical terms; the first release will contain a Java based CCF Tool for browsing and managing the CCF resources (<a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://wordnet.princeton.edu/"">WordNet</a>, the BRO and CRO, Assistive Ontologies and symbol resources). The data will be stored in or retrieved from either a MySQL database or an RDF/XML based resource. <br /></p><p>The first practical implementation will be an updated version of the <a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.symbolnet.org/en/index.html"">SYMBERED</a> tool for creating symbol supported web content via a CMS module written in PHP working towards the MySQL database.

With the Bliss Think Tank in July'07 we've been busy hacking more demonstrators. Mats, Bengt and Lars have been busy fine-tuning the <a title=""Symbol &amp; Concept Coding Editor (aka SYMBERED)"" href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.oatsoft.org/Software/SymBeRed"">SYMBERED</a> system (CCF support for CMS - using PHP, MySQL, Java). I've been busy working on a .NET infrastructure and building a central CCF ontology in SQLServer. The database I've been working with is now populated with around 9000 concepts (based on the STANDUP project ontology) and around 3000 Bliss symbols (some of which are mapped to concept codes). There is an prototype asp.net website where you can search the ontologies, update the bliss-ccf mappings, write ruby annotated bliss messages (then you can copy the source to your own website like I've done below). This webservice could be used as a portal to manage the ccf, and more excitingly, for use by other software / web applications, e.g. <a title=""FoxySymbols"" href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.oatsoft.org/Software/foxysymbols"">FoxySymbols</a>. I hope to get the webservice &amp; database hosted soon.<br /></p><h2>Background</h2><p>Around the world, people with impaired communication, including difficulties to read or write, may use symbols as an alternative or complement to character based texts. Referencing to, and exchanging these alternatively coded messages over the Internet is difficult due to the lack of standardised encoding schemes and common practises. This site is intended to motivate, describe and promote the introduction and adoption of a common, open and vendor neutral Concept Coding Framework (CCF) to overcome some of these difficulties. In particular will act as a base for all contribution to this work - be it formal documentation or informal discussions. </p><p>The suggested CCF has been carefully designed to be conformant to the standard language technologies that are rapidly developing and penetrating the Internet communities. In this way we believe that the proposed CCF can contribute to a major leap in bridging between different technologies and products developed for AAC users and, more importantly, between these Assistive Technologies (AT) and the main-stream technologies of today's and tomorrow's networked information society. </p><p>The bridging approach also implies that the CCF is not intended to replace and exclude the use and development of current and future proprietary assistive technologies in the AAC field. Instead the CCF and its bridging technology and tools are designed to provide added value for all stake-holders; AAC users, special product developers and service providers, as well as general service and information providers who want to support improved accessibility to their products. </p><p>Designed to be used over the Internet for email, web-based activities, chat and/or other emerging Internet based services, the CCF technology can, however, be used by software manufacturers also to provide additional functionality, enhanced support for, and integration of, software and systems with multi-modal language features mainly intended for local use. </p><p>Although, this work is part of the EU funded WWAAC project, the concept coding work is to be kept open source as we want to collaborate with experts and stakeholders in both the AAC field and internet technologies/accessibility area. Thus we are wanting to use this area to establish an interest group in the concept coding approach. if you are interested in getting involved at whatever level then please contact us.</p><h2>Links</h2><p>These are some of the most relevant links i can think of to share, if you have others, please add them. </p><h3>research projects</h3><ul type=""circle""><li><a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.wwaac.eu/"">wwaac</a> project (the eu project that funded this initial work) </li></ul><blockquote><div align=""left""><ul><li>""<a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.wwaac.eu/products/Docs/D10_v10%20CoP.pdf"">Code ofPractice</a>"" -

"Dasher";"Dasher is an information-efficient text-entry interface, driven by natural continuous pointing gestures.";"<h2 class=""Heading"">From the authors:</h2><p>Dasher is a zooming interface. You point where you want to go, and the display zooms in wherever you point. The world into which you are zooming is painted with letters, so that any point you zoom in on corresponds to a piece of text. The more you zoom in, the longer the piece of text you have written. You choose what you write by choosing where to zoom. </p><p></p><p>To make the interface efficient, we use the predictions of a language model to determine how much of the world is devoted to each piece of text. Probable pieces of text are given more space, so they are quick and easy to select. Improbable pieces of text (for example, text with spelling mistakes) are given less space, so they are harder to write. The language model learns all the time: if you use a novel word once, it is easier to write next time. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>A big advantage of Dasher over other predictive text-entry interfaces that offer word-completions to the user is that it is <b>mode-free</b>: the user does not need to switch from a writing mode to an ""accept-model-predictions"" mode. </p><p>Another advantage is that it is easy to train the model on any writing style: simply load up an example file, then write away!</p><br /><h2 class=""Heading"">OATS Comment:</h2><p>Dasher is an amazing innovation on on-screen keyboards - although at first it might seem difficult, stick with it and you will be astounded at how efficient it is.  Although mainly aimed at users who can use a mouse (or similar device) the Dasher team are working on a switch accessible version.  There is also a version that works well with speech recognition software - <a title=""Speech Dasher"" href=""resolveuid/d8eeddfaf075fb166fb7a4b60529a52d"" target=""_self"">Speech Dasher</a>.<br /></p><h2 class=""Heading"">See Dasher in action:</h2><p>David MacKay demonstrated Dasher at the Bett 2006 Special Needs Fringe and you can <a href=""/web/20150424043338/http://www.l4l.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=76&amp;Itemid=1"" target=""_self"">watch the video</a> created by Leon Cych.Dasher 4.9.0 is now available for download from:</p><p> </p><p>  <a href=""/web/20150424043338/http://download.gnome.org/sources/dasher/4.9/"">http://download.gnome.org/sources/dasher/4.9/</a></p><p> </p><p>Windows binaries will shortly be available from:</p><p> </p><p> <a href=""/web/20150424043338/http://www.dasher.org.uk/Download.html"">http://www.dasher.org.uk/Download.html</a></p><p> </p><p>Dasher is a predictive text input system for the GNOME Desktop, suitable for any situation in which a conventional keyboard cannot be used.</p><p> </p><p>This is the first in a new development series, including a large number of improvements from a wide variety of contributors.

It will cover a set of concepts covering the authorized Blissymbolics vocabulary of around 4450 Bliss-words. These will be organised in a Base Reference Ontology (BRO) with concepts covered by WordNet, and a Complementary Reference Ontology (CRO) for the rest. The Concept Coded concepts in the Reference Ontologies will be linked to an open ended numbers of so called Assistive Ontologies containing the different supported language representations for the concepts - Bliss being the first target for graphical symbol representations, and English and Swedish being the first natural language lexicons fully supported. The structure is already prepared for supporting a number of other symbolic representations, as well as all Scandinavian/Nordic, and a number of other European languages. More will be added as soon as interest and resources will be around. <br /></p><p>In technical terms; the first release will contain a Java based CCF Tool for browsing and managing the CCF resources (<a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://wordnet.princeton.edu/"">WordNet</a>, the BRO and CRO, Assistive Ontologies and symbol resources). The data will be stored in or retrieved from either a MySQL database or an RDF/XML based resource. <br /></p><p>The first practical implementation will be an updated version of the <a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.symbolnet.org/en/index.html"">SYMBERED</a> tool for creating symbol supported web content via a CMS module written in PHP working towards the MySQL database.

With the Bliss Think Tank in July'07 we've been busy hacking more demonstrators. Mats, Bengt and Lars have been busy fine-tuning the <a title=""Symbol &amp; Concept Coding Editor (aka SYMBERED)"" href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.oatsoft.org/Software/SymBeRed"">SYMBERED</a> system (CCF support for CMS - using PHP, MySQL, Java). I've been busy working on a .NET infrastructure and building a central CCF ontology in SQLServer. The database I've been working with is now populated with around 9000 concepts (based on the STANDUP project ontology) and around 3000 Bliss symbols (some of which are mapped to concept codes). There is an prototype asp.net website where you can search the ontologies, update the bliss-ccf mappings, write ruby annotated bliss messages (then you can copy the source to your own website like I've done below). This webservice could be used as a portal to manage the ccf, and more excitingly, for use by other software / web applications, e.g. <a title=""FoxySymbols"" href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.oatsoft.org/Software/foxysymbols"">FoxySymbols</a>. I hope to get the webservice &amp; database hosted soon.<br /></p><h2>Background</h2><p>Around the world, people with impaired communication, including difficulties to read or write, may use symbols as an alternative or complement to character based texts. Referencing to, and exchanging these alternatively coded messages over the Internet is difficult due to the lack of standardised encoding schemes and common practises. This site is intended to motivate, describe and promote the introduction and adoption of a common, open and vendor neutral Concept Coding Framework (CCF) to overcome some of these difficulties. In particular will act as a base for all contribution to this work - be it formal documentation or informal discussions. </p><p>The suggested CCF has been carefully designed to be conformant to the standard language technologies that are rapidly developing and penetrating the Internet communities. In this way we believe that the proposed CCF can contribute to a major leap in bridging between different technologies and products developed for AAC users and, more importantly, between these Assistive Technologies (AT) and the main-stream technologies of today's and tomorrow's networked information society. </p><p>The bridging approach also implies that the CCF is not intended to replace and exclude the use and development of current and future proprietary assistive technologies in the AAC field. Instead the CCF and its bridging technology and tools are designed to provide added value for all stake-holders; AAC users, special product developers and service providers, as well as general service and information providers who want to support improved accessibility to their products. </p><p>Designed to be used over the Internet for email, web-based activities, chat and/or other emerging Internet based services, the CCF technology can, however, be used by software manufacturers also to provide additional functionality, enhanced support for, and integration of, software and systems with multi-modal language features mainly intended for local use. </p><p>Although, this work is part of the EU funded WWAAC project, the concept coding work is to be kept open source as we want to collaborate with experts and stakeholders in both the AAC field and internet technologies/accessibility area. Thus we are wanting to use this area to establish an interest group in the concept coding approach. if you are interested in getting involved at whatever level then please contact us.</p><h2>Links</h2><p>These are some of the most relevant links i can think of to share, if you have others, please add them. </p><h3>research projects</h3><ul type=""circle""><li><a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.wwaac.eu/"">wwaac</a> project (the eu project that funded this initial work) </li></ul><blockquote><div align=""left""><ul><li>""<a href=""/web/20150926215143/http://www.wwaac.eu/products/Docs/D10_v10%20CoP.pdf"">Code ofPractice</a>"" -

"Dasher";"Dasher is an information-efficient text-entry interface, driven by natural continuous pointing gestures.";"<h2 class=""Heading"">From the authors:</h2><p>Dasher is a zooming interface. You point where you want to go, and the display zooms in wherever you point. The world into which you are zooming is painted with letters, so that any point you zoom in on corresponds to a piece of text. The more you zoom in, the longer the piece of text you have written. You choose what you write by choosing where to zoom. </p><p></p><p>To make the interface efficient, we use the predictions of a language model to determine how much of the world is devoted to each piece of text. Probable pieces of text are given more space, so they are quick and easy to select. Improbable pieces of text (for example, text with spelling mistakes) are given less space, so they are harder to write. The language model learns all the time: if you use a novel word once, it is easier to write next time. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>A big advantage of Dasher over other predictive text-entry interfaces that offer word-completions to the user is that it is <b>mode-free</b>: the user does not need to switch from a writing mode to an ""accept-model-predictions"" mode. </p><p>Another advantage is that it is easy to train the model on any writing style: simply load up an example file, then write away!</p><br /><h2 class=""Heading"">OATS Comment:</h2><p>Dasher is an amazing innovation on on-screen keyboards - although at first it might seem difficult, stick with it and you will be astounded at how efficient it is.  Although mainly aimed at users who can use a mouse (or similar device) the Dasher team are working on a switch accessible version.  There is also a version that works well with speech recognition software - <a title=""Speech Dasher"" href=""resolveuid/d8eeddfaf075fb166fb7a4b60529a52d"" target=""_self"">Speech Dasher</a>.<br /></p><h2 class=""Heading"">See Dasher in action:</h2><p>David MacKay demonstrated Dasher at the Bett 2006 Special Needs Fringe and you can <a href=""/web/20150424043338/http://www.l4l.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=76&amp;Itemid=1"" target=""_self"">watch the video</a> created by Leon Cych.Dasher 4.9.0 is now available for download from:</p><p> </p><p>  <a href=""/web/20150424043338/http://download.gnome.org/sources/dasher/4.9/"">http://download.gnome.org/sources/dasher/4.9/</a></p><p> </p><p>Windows binaries will shortly be available from:</p><p> </p><p> <a href=""/web/20150424043338/http://www.dasher.org.uk/Download.html"">http://www.dasher.org.uk/Download.html</a></p><p> </p><p>Dasher is a predictive text input system for the GNOME Desktop, suitable for any situation in which a conventional keyboard cannot be used.</p><p> </p><p>This is the first in a new development series, including a large number of improvements from a wide variety of contributors.

In the meantime, the invasiveness and resource consumption is minimal.<br />(DSpeech does not install itself, is very light, starts in a second and doesn't write anything to the registry). Some notable features of DSpeech are:<br /><br />1. Allows you to save the output as a .WAV or .MP3 file.<br />2. Allows you to quickly select different voices, even combine them, or juxtapose them in order to create dialogues between different voices.<br />3. DSpeech integrates a vocal recognition system that, through a simple script language, allows you to create interactive dialogues with the user.<br />4. Allows you to configure the voices in an independent way.<br />5. Thanks to apposite TAGs, it allows you to dynamically change the features of the voices during the playback (speed, volume and frequency), to insert pauses, emphasize specific words, or even to spell them out.<br />6. Allows you to capture and reproduce the content of the ClipBoard.<br />7. DSpeech is compatible with all vocal engines (SAPI 4-5 compliant).<br />8. AI dialog system. Not really useful, but amusing.

"eStoryMaker";"A simple means for assembling text, picture and sound files into an e-story that supports multiple access means.";"<p> </p><p><b>eStoryMaker</b> is a simple program for assembling an e-story that affords multiple access methods. eStoryMaker can be used to e-book versions of your student's favorite children's books, to recap field trips or special events, to create multimedia social scripts, or to provide a multimedia accounting of each step in a task. eStoryMaker is also designed to work well with Launcher6. In spite of its name, you construct an e-story by placing text, picture and/or sound files in a folder along with the eStoryMaker.exe file. When you open eStoryMaker.exe, it loads page1.txt, page1.jpg and page1.wav (for example.) When your user asks for the next page, eStoryMaker loads the next set of files in the page sequence, if they exist. So, you have to name your picture files, record and name sound files, and create text files. You can use a clipboard text-to-speech program to read your story, if you don't want to bother with recording sound files.</p> <p>There are many freeware tools you can use to help create e-stories. To make e-books from children's books you can use a flatbed scanner, but I often just use a digital camera for quicker results. I take the books outside and shoot the pages in the shade to have good light, but no glare. For picture editing and renaming I recommend using the excellent and free IrfanView program easily obtained from the Internet. To record sound files I most often use the Sound Recorder accessory that comes with Windows. For more precise sound editing, and for converting wav to mp3 files I use the terrific free Audacity program. There are many better free, Internet available alternatives for creating text files than the default Windows Notepad. I have been using a program called EditPad that most importantly supports multiple files being open simultaneously (unlike Notepad.) Finally, I can recommend 2 freeware text-to-speech programs, Deskbot and SayzMe. Both are easily obtained on the Internet and use the freeware Microsoft Agent technology. I prefer Deskbot, and set its options to read the clipboard text only without any extra, distracting animations.</p>";"contact_address-mailto:jamjolu@hotmail.com,project_home_page-http://sites.google.com/site/jamjolu/Home/estorymaker";Educational and Learning,Learning and Education;http://sites.google.com/site/jamjolu/Home/downloads

And, best of all, it's freeware. Launcher6 covers the screen providing users with a restricted environment, allowing choices, but reducing the probability that the user will access the usual, and perhaps troublesome, Windows interface. It supports access using single switch, two switch, Intellikeys, touch screen and mouse methods. Facilitators can configure the six cells on the launcher6 screen using the built-in editor. Launcher6 continually saves this 'setup' as changes occur in a text file that ends with a '.ls6' extention. Each cell within a setup can be assigned the following:</p> <p>1. A graphic element of types: '.bmp', '.jpg', '.gif' (animation is ok), or '.png'.</p> <p>2. A cue either as a sound file or as text to be spoken via a clipboard text to speech utility.</p> <p>3. A message in the same way as the cue.</p> <p>4. A registered filetype or a program to open.</p> <p>5. A link to another launcher6 setup.</p> <p>6. An action: hide me, show all, quit, or none.</p> <p>When launcher6 starts it always loads the settings saved in the file ""main.ls6"". From the ""main"" setup you can link to other setups.

"Mouse Smoothing Software";"Assistive software for people with hand tremor.";"<h2 class=""Heading"">What is Mouse Smoothing Software? </h2><p>Mouse Smoothing Software is assistive software for people with hand tremor. It is intended primarily for individuals with Essential (non-specific) Hand Tremor who have difficulty using a computer mouse. Significant improvement has been found for people who can basically control their hand, apart from a moderate degree of tremor. </p><h2 class=""Heading"">How does it work?</h2><p>The key element of this software is a device driver program that attaches itself to the regular device driver program used to control the mouse. It intercepts the mouse motion data before it is used by the operating system and applies a low-pass digital filter to smooth out rapid, unwanted motion caused by hand tremor. The smoothed data is then passed along to the operating system, so that any program using the mouse will automatically receive smoothed mouse data. In addition to the device driver, the software includes a control panel program for personalizing the smoothing filter, as well as programs for installing and removing the driver. If the computer has more than one type of mouse connected, one can be left unsmoothed, allowing a user without hand tremor to easily share the computer. </p><p>The device driver works under the Windows® 2000 and XP operating systems. Windows 95, 98, and ME are not supported. Some mouse driver software supplied with certain mice does not work with this device driver. Instructions are supplied for identifying this software and disabling it using Window's device manager, a process that requires some care and a modicum of computer expertise. </p><p>Mouse Smoothing Software has also become available as a hardware implementation (a microprocessor-based adapter connected between the mouse and the PC) called <a href=""/web/20150101131323/http://www.montrosesecam.com/?Open&amp;ca=daw-prod-mousesmoothing"" target=""_new"">Assistive Mouse Adapter</a>.

"mouseTrap";"mouseTrap is an application (for Linux) that intends to provide control of the mouse pointer using a Web Cam and face detection. The users can move the pointer using the face or other parts of it.";"<p><strong>1) History:</strong></p> <p style=""text-align: left;"">mouseTrap started as a simple widgetsTrap (read bellow), while the development advanced new ideas were coming and one of them was the idea of creating an application to move the mouse with the head using a simple and low cost web cam. After doing some research I found OpenCV ( base library of mouseTrap ). After downloading and testing OpenCV I found out that it is capable to do amazing things including face detection. After this I just performed some other tests and apply everything into mouseTrap and so the Web Cam feature became the main function of it.</p> <p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>2)</strong><strong> Project Main Goal:</strong></p> <p style=""text-align: left;"">The main goal of the project is to become a completely accessible application for people with movement impairments and so take care of that important part of accessibility that wasn’t covered until now. With this, It’s possible to expand even more the Assistive Technology and Computer Accessibility and so make the technology accessible for more people.</p> <p style=""text-align: left;""> </p><p><strong>3) What does mouseTrap use to model the head movement into  mouse movement?</strong></p> <p style=""text-align: left;"">It calculates the 2D coordinates variation of the face movement on the Web Cam image and after that it executes the required movements with the pointer. It is a really simple calculation that gives an absolute and flexible control. The required movement is completely customizable by the user through the gtk based GUI.</p> <p style=""text-align: left;""> </p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>4) Other Important Features:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>WidgetsTrap</strong>: The widgetsTrap is a time-out focus executer feature that catches all the selectable and focusable widgets of the current window ( Desktop or any other application ) and if the mouse hasn’t been moved in the setted time-out the nearest selectable or focusable widget will be focused. A demonstration video can be found <a title=""WidgetsTrap Demo"" href=""/web/20130726045844/http://www.flaper87.org/files/videos/mouseTrapDemo.mpg"" target=""_self"">here</a></li><li><strong>HttpServer:</strong> It is a basic httpServer to communicate with mouseTrap using command line ( wget ) or a simple web browser.</li><li><strong>KeyBindings:</strong> Yes Keybindings! The keybindings let the user perform some extra mouseTrap actions like, re-detect points, enable/disable features and so on…</li><li><strong>Mousebindings</strong>: There are also mousebindings for the main or most important actions ( like re-detect points ) so the can be executed using the Web Cam too requiring less movement.</li><li><strong>Internationalisation: </strong>multi language support.</li></ul> <p style=""text-align: left;""> </p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>5) Future Features:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Eyetraking:</strong> This is the most important feature to implement, hopefully in a short future. This will allow the user to move the mouse just with the eyes, just watching the point in the screen where the mouse should be moved.</li><li><strong>Plugins Interface</strong>: a simple interface for plugins implementations.</li><li><strong>More Features to add soon…</strong></li></ul>";"contact_address-mailto:flaper87@gmail.com,project_home_page-http://live.gnome.org/MouseTrap";Environmental Control,Using the Mouse;http://git.gnome.org/browse/mousetrap/

"MyMediaPlayer (MMP)";"MyMediaPlayer is a simple switch accessible media player with a delay-to-pause feature to encourage repeated interations. MMP allows for a video file and an audio file (if desired) to be played simultaneously. File locations are stored on playlists for convenience, and the playlists and most recent setup are saved automatically. When MMP is restarted the most recent setup is loaded automatically.";"<meta http-equiv=""Content-Type"" content=""text/html; charset=windows-1252"" /> <meta name=""Generator"" content=""Microsoft Word 97"" /><title>MMP Information</title>  <meta name=""Template"" content=""C:\PROGRAM FILES\MICROSOFT OFFICE\OFFICE\html.dot"" />   <p>MMP Information</p> <b></b><p><b>myMediaPlayer</b> (MMP) is a simple adapted digital media player that offers a cause-and-effect activity for single switch users, or a simplified direct access activity for mouse, touchscreen, or Intellikeys keyboard users. The ""<b><i>delay-to-pause</i></b>"" timer stops the player after a defined interval to encourage repeated user responses. The ""<b><i>Light Switch</i></b>"" option allows a light activated switch to control a switch adapted toy or other switch adapted device.</p> <p>First, identify media elements that you think your user will like by clicking <b><i>the Add Movie/Music</i></b> buttons and locating media files. This adds items to the play lists. Clicking on play list items highlights them for playing and shows them in the selected item fields. Highlighted items can be deleted from the lists using the <b><i>Delete</i></b> buttons. <b><i>The Clear Selection</i></b> buttons removes the media elements from the selected item fields.</p> <p>You can name, save and open play lists.</p> <p>You can select 2 media elements for simultaneous play: a movie file (*.mov, *.mpg, *.mpeg, *.gif, *.swf), and/or a music file (*.mp3, *.mid, *.wav) depending upon what version of QuickTime is installed on your system (version 6.5 is preferred.) I often use this media player more as a music player and identify an animated gif element to add visual interest, or you can add music to a silent video clip.</p> <p>You can define whether the player for each media type will <b><i>loop</i></b> continuously, or <b><i>close</i></b> when the media concludes, or <b><i>neither</i></b> by clicking one of the mode buttons below each list. The close option works well with launcher programs with the player exiting directly back to the launching program.</p> <p>Single switch users can use the delay-to-pause with a switch-adapted mouse. Select a delay time from the <b><i>Delay Time</i></b> menu, or just enter a number of seconds into the nearby text box. <i>Select a delay time of 0 for continuous play</i>. After the setup the facilitator positions the mouse cursor over the <b><i>Play</i></b> button to ready the activity for the switch user. The <b><i>Pause</i></b> button is always hidden during delay-to-pause play.</p> <p>Alternatively, the switch can be plugged into the Switch 1 input of the Intellikeys keyboard that has the ""myMediaPlayer.omc"" overlay loaded. Additionally a Don Johnson Switch Interface or similar device that can send the characters '0', '1','2','3', or '4' can also control myMediaPlayer as explained below.</p> <p>By checking ""<b><i>Use Overlay</i></b>"" you will be asked to locate the 'myMediaPlayer.omc' content overlay file. The file will then be loaded, and automatically loaded each time the myMediaPlayer is opened thereafter. You will also have to have the Intellitools Overlay Sender program installed on your computer.</p> <p>The ""<b><i>Say Yes</i></b>"" and ""<b><i>Say No</i></b>"" offer users a way to indicate preferences while setting things up. The buttons respond to the Intellikeys keyboard overlay previously mentioned so that the <b><i>Play</i></b> key (switch 1) corresponds to no and the <b><i>Pause</i></b> key (switch 2) to yes.</p> <p>Finally, the <b><i>Direct Play</i></b> checkbox allows for media play only while the switch is held down. This method works only with a switch adapted mouse. Hover the mouse pointer over the Direct Play button during use.</p> <p>The ""<b><i>Set Color</i></b>"" buttons change the background color of the stack.</p> <p>myMediaPlayer automatically saves and loads settings in separate files with each use. If you move myMediaPlayer.exe around your hard drive, be sure to move MMP.qsu (the setup file), and optionally any *.ply (play lists) files so they are easily found.</p> <b></b><p><b>myMediaPlayer2 consists of 3 screens</b> -</p> <p>1.The info screen.</p> <p>2. The setup screen where you can identify a digital media files , specify audio files, select play modes, manage playlists, and set the delay-to-pause timer.</p> <p>3. The player screen.</p> <b></b><p><b>Important!-----&gt;</b> The player screen responds to the following keystrokes: 'p','0', or '1' starts the player; 'u' or '2' pauses the player; 's' or '3' opens the setup screen; 'q' or '4' ends the program. The 'p' or 'u' commands only work when the Play or Pause buttons are visible.</p> <p>The Intellikeys overlay named ""myMediaPlayer.omc"" works with myMediaPlayer. The overlay has buttons that send the control keystrokes defined above. The overlay is programmed for switch input 1 to send 'p' for play, and input 2 to send 'u' for pause.</p>";"help-http://www.oatsoft.org/Software/mymediaplayer-mmp/help,contact_address-mailto:jamlolu@hotmail.com,project_home_page-http://sites.google.com/site/jamjolu/Home/mymediaplayer";Educational and Learning,Learning and Education;http://sites.google.com/site/jamjolu/Home/mymediaplayer

The  use of the pictogram is confined solely by the limit of your imagination.</p> <p align=""justify"">Be careful however not to  over-visualise. This may reduce growing possibilities. Sometimes if we put a  little more effort and energy into it, we can help someone learn something  without the use of pictograms. </p> <p align=""justify"">When looking at the pictograms,  you may have thought some to be more or less obvious then others. You would have  thought correctly. Dont't forget that the meaning of a pictogram is what you  want it to mean. The meaning of the symbol has to be learned, like you would  words of a language. Imagin consequently calling a cat a dog when talking with a  child. It would know no better than to call a cat a dog. We are not born with a  pictogram instinct for recognition! This also means that names and meanings of  the pictograms offerde here are not definite and may be changed if you want to.  I can only build on my experiences and simply offer suggestions. Feel free to  make changes if they are needed or are desireable.</p> <p align=""justify""> </p> <p align=""justify"">When you look for a pictogram, you  will sometimes find more than one version for a certain concept or word.

You can download every  single pictogram at no cost. Other pictogram libraries may be more developed,  but require a fee. I want to break with the notion that adjustments within  caregiving always come with a price tag. I've committed myself to answering  questions and designing other pictograms when people need them.

"StarOffice 4 Kids";"StarOffice 4 Kids is a product suite for teachers and students that has emerged from a technological research project.";"<h2 class=""Heading"">From the authors:</h2><p></p><div class=""normal"">In collaboration with <a href=""/web/20131007193017/http://www.sun.com/"" target=""_blank"">Sun Microsystems, Inc.</a> and the <a href=""/web/20131007193017/http://wwwhni.uni-paderborn.de/"" target=""_blank"">Heinz-Nixdorf-Institut der Universität Paderborn</a>. <a href=""/web/20131007193017/http://www.kippdata.de/"" target=""_blank"">kippdata</a> has developed StarOffice 4 Kids into an integrated learning environment with a highly flexible functionality and user interface.<br /> <br /> StarOffice 4 Kids has been uniquely designed for easy customization by individual teachers to support specific learning objectives. It is aligned to the needs of a teacher and his or her specific teaching materials and not vice versa.<br /> <br /> StarOffice 4 Kids allows the teacher to handle an interactive learning process according to learning steps that he or she considers appropriate. Not only according to the age-specific steps of the class, but also in regard to the individual learning progress of the class or a selected group of students. Adjusted to the learning speed of the students a teacher could, for example, easily focus on the fundamentals of word processing. The teacher could start with work sheets with just the functions for using of texts in different fonts and font sizes. Once the students have learnt how to use those functions, the teacher could add new functions to the function toolbar and teach those in a next step. <br /> <br /> StarOffice 4 Kids makes it easy for the teacher to produce documents for the exercises in class. A teacher can easily transform usual office documents into task sheets for the class and store them into the subject specific folders. The students will find them in the workspace of their class. They will work on them and save them in their own workspace. This workspace only contains the personal files and that is protected from the access of other students.<br /> <br /> StarOffice 4 Kids documents and user interfaces are based on an XML data format, augmenting the open source StarOffice/OpenOffice format.

"Zen Key";"This program allows you to control almost all aspects of your computer via the keyboard by creating new keyboard shortcuts.  It can also control the mouse pointer, including its speed from keyboard shortcuts.";"<p>Using keystrokes that work no matter what program you are in, you can do actions like launch a program or  bring it back into focus; open a document, folder or Internet resource; perform an Internet search; minimize or maximize a window; issue a Media command. You can add any program, add or alter any menu, and assign any keystroke to perform any action.</p><p>Although not as powerfull as AutoHotkey its menu and wizard driven interface makes it simpler to use for those not into programming and scripting based systems.</p><p><strong>From the Web Site</strong></p><p>Zenkey is comprised of a series of menus, each item of which performs an ""action"". You can ""fire"" these actions by clicking on the item, or pressing any key-combination you choose. Using these actions, you can:</p><p align=""left""><strong>Open a program or file<br /></strong>These actions launch a program or open a document (with its associated application).
