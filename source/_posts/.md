## "A free (CC-BY-NC-SA) resource of around 5000 colour and black &amp; white pictographic symbols from Catedu and the Aragonese Portal of Augmentative and Alternative Communication in Spain."

"<h2>From the authors:</h2><p>The ARASAAC portal offers graphic resources and materials to facilitate  communication for those with some sort of problem in this area. <br /></p><h2>OATSoft comment:<br /></h2><p>This is an increasingly popular and widely used AAC resource, and the symbol file libraries are available with the file names translated into a growing number of languages. The file format provided is 500 pixels high PNG. Though the number of files is quite large, there is a fair amount of redundancy due to numerous duplication of symbols labelled with different names.<br /></p>"
