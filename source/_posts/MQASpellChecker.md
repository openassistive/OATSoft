---------------------

Spell Checker checks the spelling of any edit control in almost any application under Windows 3.1/95/98. The program was designed to run under Windows 3.1. Though it will operate under Windows 95/98, it is **_not compatible with_** later versions (2000, ME, XP). It runs in the background and is brought into use in any edit window by pressing a hot-key combination. Master dictionaries are available in several languages and fully editable and searchable custom dictionaries can be created. The system requirements are modest and it should run on any computer.
