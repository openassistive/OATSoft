Based on Ken Perlin's Quikwriting, this is a novel on-screen keyboard that works on mouse gestures.  Moving your mouse in gestures across the Qwriting window turns the gestures into letters. This can be a very efficient way of typing for people who can only use a mouse and don't want to move the mouse much...
