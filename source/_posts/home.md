OATSoft is dedicated to improving Assistive Technology and computer accessibility through the power of Open Source development techniques. OATSoft makes the best Open Source Assistive Technology Software (OATS) easy to find.  Users and developers meet at OATSoft to create better software. 
<!-- more -->
Users, find useful free software and discuss and work with developers to get the features that you want.

Developers, work with users and other projects to develop new features and shared re-usable components.

Open Source Software is free and the 'source code' that makes the software is freely available. It is developed by international communities operating on-line.

Assistive Technology Software allows people with disabilities to overcome some of the disabling effects of society and technology, including computer and web accessibility.

## Project Summary
## Project Context
## Users & Oats

If you are an Assistive Technology Software user you can help OATS grow.

OATS offers you, as an AT user, a unique opportunity to contribute to the development of AT software - on this site you can speak directly to developers who are writing AT software. In fact, you could get software written specifically to meet your needs!
By contributing to OATS you will help build up the body of knowledge about real user needs for AT software and help improve, not just OATS software, but all AT software.

It's also a good place (and maybe the only one?) to have a good moan, whinge or whine (or even praise!) about how your AT software works and how you would like it to work. You can talk to users, professionals and software developers through the different forums.

Confused? Need some help? Just want to find some software? Want to help? Try the HELP pages, FAQ, Help noticeboard or just contact us.

## Professionals & OATS

As an AT professional you could both contribute and receive a great deal from the OATS project.

Do you work in an EAT service, a school, college, university, do you work with people with disabilities and users of AT? OATS will help you in a number of ways:

* Find software! Find things that might be useful for your users
* Contribute ideas and suggestions - need something customised or one-off for a client?
* Contribute code - if you write code, please make it open-source and put it here for other people to use, contribute to and generally worship!

## Developers & OATS

Are you a software developer? You could help the OATS project.

Fancy a project that is actually user led? OATS projects are all derived from real users' needs - by contributing to a project you will be: 

* Meeting a specific user need
* Contributing to the cutting edge of a field
* Developing software that may impact on the HCI field
